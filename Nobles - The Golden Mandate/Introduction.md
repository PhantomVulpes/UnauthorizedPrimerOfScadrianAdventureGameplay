_Nobles: The Golden Mandate_ is the third player's guide and world supplement for the base game. It contains a module, lore, and a set of new mechanics for players to use to build their characters.
# In the primer
I will not be including any of the new lore explored in the world guide. The [Coppermind](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome) should have everything you need for lore. If you see any groups or locations or names you're unfamiliar with when reading the primer, then go there to find information. The primer is not a second wiki, it is exclusively for the tabletop RPG.
All new mechanics and rules will be included here rather than in the base game. There is some information that may end up in the main primer, but that is exclusively for convenience such as with [[Advancements]]. This is so players and GMs will be able to introduce these rules as they see fit for their games, getting the vanilla experience if they want or expanding into one or more world supplements.
The modules will also be included, though they may take longer to add to the primer as they are not always the highest priority.
# New Mechanics
[[Mistborn Campaign Notes/Rules/Nobles - The Golden Mandate/Noble Families|Noble Families]] - A new mechanic has been added, allowing Noble characters to take advantage of their lineage directly
    **NOTE ABOUT FAMILIES**: The introduction of this mechanic alters character creation. If you are choosing to play with this supplement from the start, make sure you read those changes.
[[Mistborn Campaign Notes/Rules/Nobles - The Golden Mandate/Stunts|Stunts]] - Stunts have been expanded to include noble characters as well as any character with the Hazekiller trait
# Extra Content
**Editor's Note**: Primarily, I am focused on the new mechanics added for each book before I come back and add the added content below
