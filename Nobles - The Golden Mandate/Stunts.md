# Academic Connections - Noble Only
You are connected to some of the best tutors and scholars of your past.
When you fail a [[Character Sheet Definitions#Wits|Wits]] roll, you may spend a day calling on colleagues and libraries to reroll. On success:

You may attempt to reroll a given [[Character Sheet Definitions#Wits|Wits]] roll only once
# Allomancer Sense - Hazekiller Trait Only
You can concentrate to find cues that another person is burning metals in your presence
Choose a character you can see and perform a [[Contests|Wits Contest]] against them. On success:
- Determine whether or not they are burning [[Metals]], **but not which one**.
- You may continue to sense your target's use of Allomancy as long as you are concentrating (taking no other actions). As soon as you act, this benefit is lost
[[Metals#Copper#Allomancy|Copperclouds]] do not prevent you from detecting Allomancy
# Atium Counteroperations - Hazekiller Trait Only
Intense training in feints and misdirection lets you battle even Mistborn who burn [[Metals#Atium#Allomancy|Atium]].
When a character is burning Atium takes an action targeting or opposing you, the number of dice they gain from Atium drops by 2
# Brittle Iron Countermeasures - Hazekiller Trait Only
Iron can't pull you as effectively due to careful addition of non-metallic weights on your body, placed so movement is not impeded
Anyone trying to pull you by burning [[Metals#Iron#Allomancy|Iron]], you add 2 dice to your [[Character Sheet Definitions#Physique|Physique]] roll and any Physique rolls to resist someone using Iron to pull an item on your body or in your posession
# Business Connections - Noble Only
Your house has many lucrative business connections.
When you fail a [[Character Sheet Definitions#Resources|Resources]] roll, you may spend a day calling in debts and short-term loans to reroll. On success:

You may attempt to reroll a failed [[Noble Families|Family]] Challenge or [[Contests|Contest]] once per session
# Filthy Rich - Noble Only
Due to a vast inheritance, favored House position, or other fortunate circumstance, you have far more money available.
You must decide what in your background resulted in this wealth.
Gain 3 [[Mistborn Campaign Notes/Rules/Base Game/Equipment#Props|Props]]
# Hazekiller Block - Hazekiller Trait Only
Your training gives you better defense against physical Allomantic attacks
When defending against an attack using a large wooden shield against physical Allomantic attacks such as [[Metals#Steel#Allomancy|coins fired by a coinshot]]:
- The shield absorbs 1 Damage
- Each [[Nudges|Nudge]] on your Defense roll causes the shield to absorb 1 more Damage.
# Hazekiller Gear - Hazekiller Trait Only
Gain a dueling cane and large wooden shield as [[Mistborn Campaign Notes/Rules/Base Game/Equipment#Props|Props]]
When buying equipment that doesn't contain metal and is either armor, shield, or weapon, the Difficulty is reduced by 1, minimum of 1
# Hazekiller Teamwork - Hazekiller Trait Only
You excel at fighting as a team, especially of hazekillers, mastering complex strategies for fighting Allomancers
When you take your action in a [[Conflicts|Conflict]], you may pass one of your Action Dice to another ally in the Conflict as if it were theirs
If an Allomancer is in the Conflict, you gain 1 bonus Action Die
- If you choose to pass one of your Action Dice, you may also pass this bonus Action Die
**Editor's Note**: Two things the book doesn't say but I assume true: First, the Allomancer must be known to you. If you don't know the combatant is an Allomancer, then you do not get these bonuses. Second: The amount of Allomancers in combat doesn't matter, you only get the one extra die.
# Mental Fortitude - Hazekiller Trait Only
You keep your wits about you when someone is using Allomancy on your mind
A character burning [[Metals#Zinc#Allomancy|Zinc]] or [[Metals#Brass#Allomancy|Brass]] against you lose 2 dice, minimum of 2
# Political Connections - Noble Only
You leverage your House's influence and skills at manipulation in politics.
When you fail an [[Character Sheet Definitions#Influence|Influence]] roll, you may spend a day calling in debts and short-term loans to reroll. On success:
- The initial roll is counted as a success
- You suffer no consequences of the initial roll
- **Editor's Note**: You didn't misread that, the book says the same thing for this stunt as it does **Business Connections**. I'm guessing it's a bit of copy-pasta, pretend it says something about politics
You may attempt to reroll a given [[Character Sheet Definitions#Influence|Influence]] roll only once
# Push Harder - Noble Allomancer Only
Once a session, you may strain yourself to temporarily increase your Allomancy rating in one [[Metals|Metal]] by 2
Suffer a [[Burdens#Serious - 1|Serious Burden]] with specifics determined by the GM
This boost lasts until the next [[Time During the Game#Breathers|Breather]]
- The Burden can last longer
You cannot use this ability again if the Burden persists
Taking this Burden does not count toward an [[Advancements|Advancement]] for taking your first Burden of the session
**Editor's Note**: The book doesn't _technically_ say it's exclusive to Allomancers but it's totally exclusive to Allomancers.
# Shatter Weapons - Hazekiller Trait Only
Because Allomancers prefer non-metallic weaponry and armor, you have trained to shatter or splinter them
When attacking, you can spend 2 [[Nudges]] to destroy your target's armor or shield if it contains no metal
- You may only do this if your attack's damage met or exceeded the total damage absorbed by the defending equipment
When defending, you can spend 2 Nudges to destroy the attacker's weapon if it contains no metal
# Snap Conditioning - Noble Only
Regardless of being an Allomancer or not, the severe pain endured in attempt to get you to Snap made you tougher
When your physical [[Burdens]] are exploited, they add one few dice to your opponent's roll
# Tin Buster - Hazekiller Trait Only
You've trained with special tools to overwhelm the senses in order to defeat [[Metals#Tin#Allomancy|Tineyes]]
Gain a flash canister, earcracker, and skunk salts as [[Mistborn Campaign Notes/Rules/Base Game/Equipment#Props|Props]]
When exploiting a [[Burdens|Burden]] caused by any of these items on an enemy's senses, add 2 dice for a Serious Burden or 3 dice for a Grave Burden
- Mortal Burdens remain unchanged
- Any character exploiting this Burden gets this benefit
