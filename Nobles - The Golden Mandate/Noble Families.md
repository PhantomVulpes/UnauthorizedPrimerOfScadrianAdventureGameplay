Unlike [[Standing|Standings]], which represent a character's influence over the world around them, Families represent the power behind a name
It is like
- A power - Roll your family pool against a difficulty to gain relevant benefits
- A [[Standing]] - Family must often be spent to roll it, recovering over time
- A [[Mistborn Campaign Notes/Rules/Terris - Wrought of Copper/Networks|Network]] - A Family has rules and expectations required, lest you be cut off
Unless provided and approved by the GM, Families are exclusive to Noble characters
- Should involve an in-character reason why a character gains these family benefits
Many noble characters can be in a family due to blood relation, there can also be a marriage involved or a character holds significant power in that house through other means
Players can change Families (with [[Advancements]]), but this should not be done lightly. There should be an in-game reason to gain these benefits
# NPCs
NPCs should _not_ have families.
No noble NPC should require a dice roll to leverage their family's name or resources.
Narratives, not dice rolls, should make your story happen
# Gaining a Family at Character Creation
Family may be gained during [[Character Creation#The Stats Questions#6. Do you have any special powers?|Question 6]] by choosing **Average** or **Strong** Powers.
- These are not in addition to the powers you could have gained. For example, you cannot choose **Strong: Mistborn**, instead you would choose **Strong: Family Misting**.
## Strong
**Family Misting**: Your character is a powerful Misting of high repute in their house. Gain the following:
- Family rating of 5 in a family of your choice
- Allomancy rating of 5 in one [[Metals|Metal]] of your choice
- One Allomantic Stunt of your choice
## Average
**Family Member**: Your character is an influential player in a Great House. Gain the following:
- A Family rating of 5 in a family of your choice
- One additional [[Character Sheet Definitions#Traits|Trait]] _or_ Stunt
# Using a Family
A character can only take advantage of their Family name while they are in good standing and following the Family's Rules
If a character breaks the Family Rules as defined in the description, they temporarily lose access to the power until the next [[Time During the Game#Long Breathers|Long Breather]], at which they may sooth things over with their Family
## Leveraging Position
A character may use their Family rating in place of [[Character Sheet Definitions#Attributes#Charm|Charm]] or [[Character Sheet Definitions#Standings#Influence|Influence]] during a [[Rolling the Dice#Challenges|Challenge]] or [[Conflicts|Conflict]], either with members of their family or using their family name
Example Scenarios
- talking up a potential match at a ball
- asking a debtor for more time to repay based on your name
- inquiring about a loan
- negotiating a contract
- making a good first impression
## Spending Family
To spend a die of Family:
- Roll a Challenge with their current Family rating against the Difficulty of the benefit they are trying to access
- The score of the Family drops by 1, regardless of success
A character may only spend Family if their rating is 2 or higher when the Challenge is made
### Using Family Benefits
A character may spend their Family for a chance to acquire one of their Family Benefits. This is a [[Rolling the Dice#Challenges|Challenge]] roll, it is not guaranteed
Provides specific contextual effects such as calling on [[Conflicts#Extras|Extras]], gaining access to equipment, or other special rules
### Calling Upon a Family Member
You may spend a Family to call upon a member of your house
To call upon a family member, you must have the ability to contact time in some way
Choose an NPC from your Family to contact
Difficulty Challenge is based on the requested family member's threat level:
- 1 : Insignificant
- 2: Mild
- 3: Average
- 4: Serious
- 5: Deadly
Upon success, the family member gets in contact with you after a period of time, determined by the GM
- A few hours in the same city, weeks if far away
The family member provides one piece of information or assistance, plus one additional piece per [[Nudges|Nudge]] before refusing further assistance
If the NPC helps the character in-person, they are considered a Villain for the purposes of any activities
- They will be friendly but likely to refuse any request that requires risking their life, position, or disgrace
- **Editor's Note**: The game often refers to players as "Heroes" and adversaries as "Villains". I don't do that in the Primer and it basically doesn't matter. Not really sure why the game chose to call out members of your family as, mechanically, villains, but maybe there's something there that I'm not considering
### Recovering Family
The GM may replenish a point of Family or restore access after breaking Family Rules under the right conditions
Characters naturally recover 1 point of Family per day
Characters recover half of their spend Family during a [[Time During the Game#Short Breathers|Short Breather]] without sitting out
Characters recover all spent Family during a [[Time During the Game#Long Breathers|Long Breather]] without sitting out
Family ties are restored if rules were broken, allowing access to the Family again
# Families and Benefits

These are the benefits for the 10 Great Houses during the Final Empire
Not all Noble characters have to come from one of these houses. A player and GM should work together to pick a set or come up with their own depending on the character
