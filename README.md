# What is this?
This is a simplified rule book companion for the Mistborn Adventure Game. While the official books have examples and information that are useful, I'm going to do my best to shift this from a simple companion (as it was originally intended to be) to a suitable replacement for the rule books after the license for the game has ended. This repository will contain page numbers as reference guides for both the digital PDF and the physical book. Those page numbers tend to be different, but I think the PDF is built around the first edition whereas the books that you're probably more likely to find are a revised second edition with fixed typos and adjusted formatting. Regardless of the version, the actual rules remain the same. Currently, I'm missing a lot of page numbers, but I have a backlog item to go in and add them. There will also be a better way to cite them that is a bit less distracting, but I haven't figured out what that looks like yet.

At the moment, I have the most important rules necessary to play the game. Combined with Roll20's character sheets, you should have what you need with just this document to start playing the game. If there is anything missing, please let me know. You can find my email and a link to my BlueSky on my GitHub profile, PhantomVulpes. You're also welcome to fork or create a pull request with fixes if you find any, or open issues on the repository. There is also now a [[Character Sheet Template]] if you choose not to play on Roll20 or keep your own sheets as reference. The advantage of this, if you check the example template, is Obsidian lets you link items directly. 

I bought all of the books, including the supplemental materials for Terris: Wrought of Copper, Skaa: Tin and Ash, and Nobles: The Golden Mandate, as well as the Era 2 expansions Allow of Law and Alloy of Law: Masks of the Past. They will all be added as this repository sort of becomes the means of preserving the game. Rules that are from the game supplements will be marked as such.

# Why did I even do this?
There's no easy way to say this, the base rulebook is written like the creator has rampant ADHD, wrote the whole thing over one hell of a hyper-fixated weekend, and ran to publish it before they lost interest. Information is repeated multiple times, there's tons of fluff, unending examples, and goes down so many rabbit holes it dug straight through Wonderland. While this information is definitely useful, it makes the book _fucking massive_, intimidating, and difficult to find what you need quickly during a game session. So I devised this as a solution.

This companion guide is meant to be read using the Obsidian notetaking app, available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as mobile devices. It formats the documents properly with Markdown syntax, allows placing links to files into documents, and even lets me embed files into other files and drill down to specific headers. This means the rules on Recovery can be in their own files but be displayed in the Conflicts file exactly as it is written.

Technically you don't need Obsidian and you can just read it on GitHub but the formatting is going to be fucked up.
