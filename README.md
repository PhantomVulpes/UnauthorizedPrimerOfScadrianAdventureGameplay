This is a simplified rulebook companion for the Mistborn Adventure Game.
This is in no way official and I recommend you purchase the original book, as it provides examples and elaborations, rulings I may have skipped over, character sheets, and other supplemental material that a GM may consider necessary. It also provides page numbers for further references and extended information. Consider this a companion, not a replacement.

The base rulebook is written like the creator has rampant ADHD, wrote the whole thing over one hell of a hyper-fixated weekend, and ran to publish it before they lost interest. Information is repeated multiple times, there's tons of fluff, unending examples, and goes down so many rabbit holes it dug straight through Wonderland. While this information is definitely useful when needed, another reason why I think the book is required, this is the simplest way to explain the rules.

This companion guide is meant to be read using the Obsidian notetaking app, available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as mobile devices. It formats the documents properly with Markdown syntax, allows placing links to files into documents, and even lets me embed files into other files and drill down to specific headers. This means the rules on Recovery can be in their own files but be displayed in the Conflicts file exactly as it is written.

Technically you don't need Obsidian and you can just read it on GitHub but the formatting is going to be fucked up
