# Earning Advancements
Advancements are awarded to a character by the GM for various reasons
- Completing a scheme or goal
    - This scheme does not need to be successful to earn an Advancement
- Completing a personal goal
- Making a critical choice
- Revealing a significant secret
- Defeating a foreboding villain
- Fulfilling a character's [[Character Sheet Definitions#Destiny|Destiny]]
    - Upon reaching their Destiny, a character may take on a new one to work toward
- Overcoming a character's [[Character Sheet Definitions#Tragedy|Tragedy]]
    - Similar to Destiny, except, instead of lying in the future, it lies in the past. A character may experience a new Tragedy to overcome
- Grappling with a character's [[Burdens]]
- Achievements vital to the crew's survival
- Achievements vital to the story
- Staying in character/strong roleplay moments
- Promoting a respectful play environment
    - This is an Advancement rewarded for out-of-character play at the table
A GM should expect to reward 1-3 Advancements for each character during a session
Max of 20 Advancements
# Spending Advancements
Advancements may only be spent during a [[Time During the Game#Long Breathers|Long Breather]]
A character may only make one improvement at a time, no matter how long the Breather lasts
