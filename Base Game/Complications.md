A setback that impacts the character and/or crew members around
Applied with each point of a [[Rolling the Dice#Outcome|Negative Outcome]]
- With enough Complications, the GM may apply a single complication that effects the allies nearby
Players may suggest Complications when an adversary suffers complications
It is recommended to apply complications that draw in other players and raise the stakes
Examples
- Fighting and getting backed against a ledge
- Narrowly missing an arrow and cutting a rope instead
- Failing to pick a lock, losing a [[Time During the Game#Beats|Beat]] and breaking the pick
The GM may choose to not have an immediate effect, rather opting to hang on to the event to be recalled at an important moment
- Fleeing and crashing into a merchant stand. That merchant could mock the character at a critical time
Penalties to Complications should be marginal
