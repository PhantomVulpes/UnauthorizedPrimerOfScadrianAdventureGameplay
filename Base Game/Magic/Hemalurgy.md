The least known and least understood magic of the Final Empire
Involves killing someone with a metal spike in order to steal one of their abilities, which can then be driven into someone else's body to grant that stolen power
- See [[Metals]] for more information regarding each spike and metal used, i.e. [[Metals#Zinc#Hemalurgy|Zinc Hemalurgy]]
The size of the spike is unrelated to the power it contains
Even when a spike pierces a vital organ, it poses no danger unless the spike is removed
A spike must be large enough to kill someone but it need not be all of an object used to kill
Creating a spike is complex, as is correctly placing one
**Editor's Note**: Normally I refrain from including the "Notes from Brandon" content as they tend to be lore or rule clarifications, but this one seems interesting for narratives: "Hemalurgy is poorly understood, even by its practitioners. Many creatures can be crafted with the dark art and only a few are commonly found in the Final Empire. When creating your own story, feel free to use Hemalurgy to create your own unique monstrosities, even ones not seen in the novels."
# Gaining Spikes
## Mechanics
When an Allomancer gains a spike with a metal they can use, their rating increases by the spike's rating
- If the rating increases over 10, extra is converted to [[Nudges]] when rolling with the power
There are no additional benefits to spiking a Feruchemist with a Feruchemical spike
Abilities stolen through Hemalurgy are actually someone else's powers. Stealing Feruchemy means that character can use their metalminds. The character is literally using that person's power
Hemalurgic spikes often come with a reduced stat, as detailed with that metal's spike. If the stat ever drops to 0 as a result of the spike, they are under Ruin's (and thus the GM's) control
- The player will probably need a new character sheet after this
## Making a Spike
Use a spike of the correct metal composition and purity and pound it through a victim's body
Pierce a particular vital organ or area. The victim is instantly killed and a piece of their spirit is transferred to the spike
**Only one ability may be stolen from a victim**
For each week the spike is not piercing a new body, the rating drops by 1, minimum of 2
# Removing a Spike
Spikes must penetrate vital organs such as the eyes or heart
- **Editor's Note**: Not sure what part of Vin's earlobe is vital. This is more of a game rule rather than the actual lore
Manual removal of a spike requires a Physique - DC 5 roll and leaves a character immobilized or incapacitated
An Allomancer may [[Metals#Steel#Allomancy|Steelpush]] or [[Metals#Iron#Allomancy|Ironpull]] to remove a spike after succeeding a [[Contests|Contest]] of their metal vs. the character's Physique AND achieving an [[Rolling the Dice#Outcome|Outcome]] of 5+
Upon successful removal of a spike, lose 5 Health
- Losing all of their health, the character instantly dies from the trauma
The spike may be transferred to another character without spending [[Advancements]]
- Any cost from the spike such as reduced Charm are still incurred
# Hemalurgic Creations
## Koloss
Humans pierced by [[Metals#Iron#Hemalurgy#Spikes|four Iron spikes]]
Their bodies become incredibly strong, their skin turns blue, memories fade, and their mind descends into a cycle of boredom, hunger, and rage
Continue to grow in height and mass throughout life
Those not killed on battle eventually die as their hearts burst
A powerful Allomancer can direct a Koloss horde
- Steel Inquisitors are often at the center of a coordinated koloss action
## Kandra
Kandra are mistwraiths enhanced by a pair of metal spikes, called Blessings
The mistraith is raised from its mindless existence and is given new abilities determined by the Hemalurgic spike used
- See [[Metals]], i.e. [[Metals#Iron#Hemalurgy#Blessings|Iron Blessings]], for more information
Kandra and their complex society are hidden far from humans. Most human interactions are arranged through a Contract paid for with Atium
Vulnerable to emotional Allomancy
- This fact is well hidden to humans
Consider the Lord Ruler highly, referring to him as The Father
## Steel Inquisitors
Humans whose bodies have been enhanced by 11 or more spikes
Most powerful creatures in Scadrial behind the Lord Ruler himself
