Allomancy is an incredibly rare ability among Nobility
Of the three magic systems in the world, Allomancy is the most common
During the Final Empire, only ten Allomantic metals are known
- Tin
- Pewter
- Iron
- Steel
- Copper Bronze
- Zinc
- Brass
On the character sheet, each metal is rated from 2 to 10 dice, 2 being weak and 10 being very powerful
Depending on the amount of metal ingested, a character gains a certain number of charges they can burn

| Charges | Amount                                                                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 1 gram or pinch of metal flakes; contents of a Mistborn vial per metal; a bead of Atium |
| 2       | Several grams of metal flakes; a nail, earring, copper clip                             |
| 3       | 1/2 ounce of metal falkes; contents of a Misting vial; a boxing                         |
| 4       | 1 ounce of metal flakes; a metal nugget or padlock                                      |
| 5       | Several ounces of metal flakes; a handful of metal dust; a small bar of metal           |
# Metallic Purity
Any Allomancer can identify impure metals with a Wits - DC 4 roll
When burning an impure metal, their Physique and rating with the metal ingested are halved, rounded down
- These scores return to normal once the metal is completely burned
- If a character's Physique drops to 0, the character falls unconscious and dies in the next several minutes without assistance
    - Assistance requires a Wits - DC 3 roll
        - **Editor's Note**: That's all the book says. I guess it's enough to go "Hey, he's burning a shit metal!" and then they're fine?
Impure metals cannot be flared
# Unburned Metals
Metals can become toxic if they are not burned
When a charge is not completely burned within 8 hours of ingestion, the Allomancer loses 1 Health per unburned charge
- If a character's Health drops to 0, the character falls unconscious and dies in the next several minutes without assistance
    - Assistance requires a Wits - DC 3 roll
