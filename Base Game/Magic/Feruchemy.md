The magic of the Terris people
Use various metals to store and retrieve (tap) traits and capabilities such as strength, weight, or health
Objects used to store and tap are known as metalminds
A Feruchemist must be in direct contact with a metalmind to store or tap charges
A Feruchemist can only use their own metalminds
Feruchemical power is rated 1 to 10
- The maximum number of charges capable of being stored per hour is equal to their rating with that metal
    - During a [[Time During the Game#Short Breathers|short breather]], the maximum is their rating x10 with that metal
    - During a [[Time During the Game#Long Breathers|long breather]], the maximum is their rating x30 with that metal
- The maximum number of charges capable of being tapped per action is equal to their rating x10 with that metal
Storing is a fundamental change in the character, encourage roll playing while storing charges such as health
The amount of charges a metalmind can store depends on the size of the metal object
Storing and tapping is second nature for many Feruchemists
- If there is a loud noise, a Feruchemist may store hearing to dampen the sound

# Rolling and Tapping 10 or More Charges
For every 10 charges tapped, the [[Rolling the Dice#Outcome|outcome]] of the action improves by 1, maximum of 6
Charges tapped in this way do _not_ grant the other effects listed for the metal
The player _must always_ declare that they are tapping 10 or more charges before the roll is made
# Tapping for a Nudge
A Feruchemist may tap charges to increase the speed, accuracy, or effectiveness of their efforts
By tapping 5 charges, the player may add 1 [[Nudges|Nudge]] to a related action or roll
Charges tapped in this way do _not_ grant the other effects listed for the metal
The player _must always_ declare that they are tapping 5 or more charges before the roll is made
