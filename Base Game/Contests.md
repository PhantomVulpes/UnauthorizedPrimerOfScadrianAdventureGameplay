When two or more characters compete
Examples:
- A chase
- Bribing a noble
Outcome is determined the same as any roll with a Difficulty or CR of the opposing side
- Example: Player A rolls a 3, Player B rolls a 2, Player A wins with a +1
Some contests may not necessarily end up with either side succeeding
- Example: Two Allomancers soothing a Koloss army in their favor
A tie extends into the next beat
Difficulty may only apply to one side of the Contest
# Extended Contests
GM determines how many successes are needed to win
- Between two and five
    - Number is based on complexity, but keep in mind that too many can be tedious rather than fun
Rolls are made once per beat
First character to get the final success is the winner
# Contests Involving Multiple Participants
## On Two Sides
Everyone rolls their dice and only the best result on each side is used
When the number of participants on a side may offer an advantage, a [[Circumstances|Circumstance]] may be Warranted
## Three or More Sides
Each side declares an action
- May be done in secret
Rolls are made normally
- Actions that succeed and aren't in direct conflict with another action are successful
- Actions that conflict are resolve as a normal Contest
