# Start with the Crew
The main characters, the party, the players
Together with the GM and the other players, come up with answers to the following:
- What is your crew's common cause?
    - Liberate the skaa
    - Seek forbidden knowledge
    - Dismantle a noble house
- Who is your crew's primary target?
    - The Steel Ministry
    - The army
    - A noble
    - A social norm
- What is your crew's preferred method?
    - Open warfare
    - Deception
    - Theft
Write the answers to these questions on your character sheet under "Cause", "Target", and "Method" respectively.
Players can use this opportunity to discuss prior relationships with each other.
**Editor's Note**: If I had to rank these of importance, it's Common Cause, Preferred Method, Primary Target. Most of these are best at the start of the game when determining the story rather than something to be stuck to throughout the game. The approach to creating a crew like this also implies that the players should be a crew to start the game, but this does not have to be the case.
# Devise a Concept
Short and simple, only a few words
Something that you may describe your character as to someone who isn't playing the game.
Examples for concepts:
- Kandra spy
- Veteran Hazekiller
- Skaa performer
- Wise elder
- Newly-snapped Mistborn
Write this on your character sheet under "Concept"
**Editor's Note**: If it helps, think of this as sort of a class for your character.
# Answer These 10 Questions
Many answers to these questions will all become [[The Character Sheet#Traits|Traits]]. Be sure to understand what Traits cannot be as well as what they can be.
**Editor's Note**: Some of these questions refer to the crew and having already joined, but again your players may not have been in the position to have joined the crew before the game started. Really, this is my only criticism of character-creation. I have used these 10 questions in other game systems to help players build more interesting characters.
## 1. Why did you join the crew?
What is your main goal that you are trying to accomplish? These are not necessarily known to all characters
Examples:
- Avenge my family
- Win back my lost love
- Restore my honor
- Become the top noble house
Write this on your character sheet under "Drive"
## 2. How did you live before you joined the crew?
Where did they come from to get here?
Examples:
- Thief
- Beggar
- Spy
- Gangster
- Apprentice
- Farmer
- Con Artist
Write this answer on your character sheet under "Profession".
## 3. What special skill do you bring to the crew?
Every character is important somehow, what can you do that most cannot?
Examples:
- Safecracker
- Good with knives
- An ear for lies
- Quiet as a mouse
- Trained officer
- Sense for danger
Write this under "Specialty"
## 4. What is your most distinctive feature?
What is something that can be used to describe your character's identity to someone who has never met them?
- Devilish smile
- Air of superiority
- Sharply dressed
- Tiny frame
- Provincial accent
- Talkative
Write this under "Feature"
## 5. How do other people describe your personality?
A dominant aspect of your character's personality that someone else might take note of
This is not necessarily how they personally see themselves, but how someone else perceives them
Examples:
- Focused
- Trustworthy
- Cautious
- Reckless
- Funny
- Callous
- Kind
- Nonchalant
Write this under "Personality"
This is the final question that determines a Trait
## The Stats Questions
For questions 6, 7, and 8, you _must_ answer one with **strong**, one with **average**, and one with **weak**.
See [[Rolling the Dice#Dice Pools|Rolling the Dice]] for how these stats are used.
### 6. Do you have any special powers?
You may want to play the most powerful magic users in the game, but there are costs to such powers. A Mistborn is versatile, but will have a harder time being as powerful as a Misting. Those with no powers have had a life of struggle to get where they are today. Powers are not everything.
These powers can influence your race
You have **weak** powers if you are a mortal with no powers. You gain two additional Traits.
You have **average** powers if you are a **Misting** with only one Allomantic power or you are a shape-shifting **kandra** with **mimicry**.
You have **strong** powers if you are a **Mistborn** with all Allomantic powers or you are a **Keeper/Feruchemist** with Feruchemical powers.
#### Misting
Use of any single Allomantic [[Metals|metal]] of your choice, provided the context of your game's world
One Stunt of your choice with that metal
#### Mistborn
Allomancy rating of 4 in all metals
#### Keeper/Feruchemist
Feruchemy rating of 3 in all metals
May use all Feruchemical metalminds
**Note**: A Keeper is a particular group, dedicated to preserving the art. All Keepers are Feruchemists but not all Feruchemists are Keepers
#### Kandra/Mimicry
Mimicry rating of 5
One Hemalurgic blessing from the following options:
- Awareness
- Potency
- Presence
- Stability
See [[Metals]] for information on various metals and their Hemalurgic blessing abilities
### 7. How are your [[The Character Sheet#Attributes|attributes]]? Are you especially fit, smart, or charismatic?
This is for your Physique, Charm, and Wits
Each level has an amount of points you can spend between all Attributes
Each level has a max amount a stat can be
Each stat must have at least 2
**Weak**
- 9 points
- Max of 4
**Average**
- 11 points
- Max of 5
**Strong**
- 13 points
- Max of 8
### 8. How is your [[The Character Sheet#Standings|standing]]? Are you well-off or do you struggle to get by?
This is for your Resources, Influence, and Spirit
Each level has an amount of points you can spend between all Attributes
Each level has a max amount a stat can be
Each stat must have at least 2
**Weak**
- 9 points
- Max of 4
**Average**
- 11 points
- Max of 6
**Strong**
- 13 points
- Max of 8
## 9. What is the worst thing that has ever happened to you?
You can look at previous answers to aid in answering this question. Do you struggle to get by? What is your drive? What is your specialty? Relating these can make for a more interesting character and serve as inspiration
Examples:
- Orphaned at a young age
- Nearly starved to death
- Betrayed by your former crew
- Disowned by your family
Write this under "Tragedy"
## 10. What do you believe is your ultimate purpose?
Beyond your reason for joining a crew, what pushes you toward your ultimate goal?
This answer should differ from your Drive in question 1.
Think big, this can be used by the GM as a large story moment and help shape the overall narrative.
This may not be your true destiny as pertaining to your GM's plans, but is what your character believes they are meant to do
Examples:
- Discover a new Allomantic metal
- Defeat an Inquisitor
- Raise a new kingdom
- Free the skaa
- Establish a noble house
Write this under "Destiny"
