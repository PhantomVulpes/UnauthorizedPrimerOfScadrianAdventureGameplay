# Tin
Tin is readily available, exceedingly common, and quite inexpensive. All three magical traditions use Tin to enhance the physical senses.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Tin is called a Tineye.
Burning Tin enhances the Allomancer’s senses. While burning Tin, an Allomancer can hear distant conversation, see great distances with clarity, and finely distinguish smells, tastes and textures. However, like all Allomancy, the degree of enhancement is limited; for example, Tin doesn’t let a character see in absolute ­darkness or read a parchment from hundreds of yards away. It does let a character see further through the mists, and more clearly than any ordinary human, even in dim light. So long as the character has at least a little ambient illumination — generally, anywhere but underground, in a sealed room, or in a dense forest on a cloudy night — he or she can see as well as an ordinary person during the day.
Because all senses are enhanced equally, a character burning or flaring Tin is vulnerable to loud noises, sudden bright lights, and extremely strong smells. Hazekillers often use this to their advantage, exploiting these vulnerabilities to disorient Allomancers and move in for the kill.
### Rules
While burning Tin, you may add your Tin rating to Wits rolls that involve hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Unlike sensory boosts from Feruchemy and Hemalurgy, Tin enhances all your senses equally. However, sudden stimulus like extremely loud noises, exceptionally bright lights, and strong smells can temporarily overwhelm your senses. If you’re ­subjected to such while burning or flaring Tin you must make a Physique roll, and with failure you lose two dice from your next pool as you reel from sensory ­overload (this penalty fades by 1 die per minute if no pools are formed in
that time).
### Burn Rate
Tin burns quite slowly with each charge lasting one hour, and this makes it one of the easiest metals to burn continuously. When flared, Tin burns at a rate of 6 minutes per charge.
### Flaring
In addition to increasing your Tin rating by 1, flaring this metal also lets you “shake off” sleepiness, nausea, and similar conditions. While flaring Tin, you do not lose dice for having 0 Health
### Stunts
#### Blindsight (Trait)
Your senses are so acute that you can feel vibrations through the floor, use sound as a sort of “sonar,” and sense the movement of air on your skin. This lets you move and act normally even in complete darkness, when blindfolded, and any other time you’re left sightless. You still cannot take action that requires sight, however, like reading or distinguishing color. In addition to its story implications and descriptive applications, this Stunt grants the “Blindsight” Trait while you’re burning or flaring Tin.
#### Focused Sense
While burning Tin you add one additional die with rolls relying on one sense (chosen when you acquire this Stunt). You may gain this Stunt up to five times, once for each sense.
#### Piercing Sight (Trait)
While burning Tin you can see twice as far through mists, and may also see clearly through thin objects like sheer curtains, dirtied windows, or murky water. In addition to its story implications and descriptive applications, this Stunt grants the “Piercing Sight” Trait while you’re burning or flaring Tin.
#### Sense Memory
You have near-perfect memory with a single sense, letting you identify familiar voices or smells, distinguish forged signatures from real ones you’ve seen before, and so forth. No roll is required for these actions — they’re automatically successful. You may gain this Stunt up to five times, once for each sense.
### Savants
A Tineye Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Tin rolls, but is also so dependent upon enhanced senses that the world seems dull and grey without them. When not burning Tin, the Savant loses 1 die with Wits rolls relying on the senses.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Tin to store individual senses (unlike Allomancers, Feruchemists must store and use each sense separately, in its own metalmind — for example, sight in one tinmind and ­hearing in another). Like other Feruchemical applications, a character’s ­access to a sense is greatly limited while storing it (thus, while storing smell, a Feruchemist would barely taste or smell ­anything, and while storing sight, he would become nearsighted or virtually blind).
### Storing
While storing a sense, you lose 1 die per charge ­currently being stored with Wits rolls involving that sense. Again, you may only store one sense per tinmind. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Tin rating or your Wits score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with Wits rolls involving the chosen sense. However, sudden stimulus involving the tapped sense — like extremely loud noises when tapping hearing, exceptionally bright lights when tapping sight, and strong odors when tapping smell — can temporarily overwhelm your senses. If you’re subjected to such while tapping Tin you must make a Physique roll, and with failure you lose two dice from your next pool as you reel from sensory overload (this penalty fades by 1 die a minute if no pools are formed in that time).
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of a sense can perform incredible feats with it, like listening to a soft conversation occurring on the other side of a wide lake or reading a sign posted miles away. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Tin include:

| Charges Tapped | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | See outdoors at night as if it were daylight; identity someone by smell; determine whether food or drink is poisoned by taste; hear a whispered conversation five yards away in a room with background noise                                                                                                                  |
| 20             | See in a darkened room as if it were daylight; track by smell like a<br>bloodhound; determine which contaminant has been added to food<br>or drink by taste; hear a whispered conversation ten yards away in a<br>noisy room; observe someone picking a pocket at fifty yards                                                 |
| 30             | See in near-total darkness as if it were daylight; track someone by<br>smell in a light rain or after a full day has passed; determine the exact<br>ingredients of a recipe by taste; hear well enough to fight hand-to-<br>hand in complete darkness without penalty; observe someone picking<br>a pocket at a hundred yards |
| 50             | Track someone by smell in the midst of an ashfall or after a week has passed; determine who handled an item or cooked a dish by taste; hear well enough to fight at range in complete darkness without penalty; observe someone picking a pocket at five hundred yards                                                        |
| 90             | Read fine print by touch; track someone by smell after a month has<br>passed; determine the origin of a food or metal by taste; hear well<br>enough to hit someone with an arrow through a wall at five hundred<br>yards in complete darkness; observe someone picking a pocket a mile<br>away                                |
## Hemalurgy
Tin spikes store human senses. Each spike can hold a single sense, and greatly improves that sense in a character who receives it. Unfortunately, as with any spike that steals an inherent human ability, a Tin spike distorts the recipient, causing physical deformations and possibly madness or memory loss.
Tin spikes are employed as one of the four Blessings available to kandra. Unlike their use in humans, the Tin Blessing (of Awareness) enhances all of a kandra’s senses in a manner similar to an Allomancer burning the metal.
### Spikes
Costs 4 [[Advancements#Spending Advancements|Advancements]].
A Tin spike adds 2 dice with Wits rolls involving one sense (chosen when the spike is used to steal it). However, both your Charm and Spirit scores drop by 1 for each Tin spike you receive (rather than just your Spirit).
### Blessings
The Blessing of Awareness adds 2 dice with rolls involving all your senses.  dditionally, you’re considered to have 2 additional Action Dice when determining the order of actions in a Conflict (e.g. when you gain 4 ­Action Dice, the order in which you act is determined as if you have 6 Action Dice instead).
# Pewter
Pewter is an alloy mostly composed of tin and copper. It’s common, inexpensive, and widely available. For each of the magical traditions, Pewter is the embodiment of strength and raw physical power.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Pewter is called a Thug or Pewterarm.
Burning Pewter enhances the Allomancer’s body and physical capabilities. While burning Pewter, a character becomes faster and stronger, with greater manual dexterity, agility, and endurance. All else being equal, a trained warrior burning Pewter is easily a match for half a dozen ordinary human warriors.
Pewter also increases healing speed, letting the character recover ­considerably faster and more completely than any ordinary human. While it doesn’t ­prevent ­aging, it can slow or stop the effects of disease and poison. Highly skilled ­characters can even burn while unconscious — a trick that’s saved many a grievously wounded Thug or Mistborn.
An extended Pewter burn lets a character run or perform similarly draining activities without pause for hours at a time, but it can also result in a potentially life-threatening collapse afterward (a condition that’s often called a “Pewter drag”). Only by burning Pewter for several hours after such an exertion does the character in this position stand a chance of survival; running out of metal beforehand risks severe injury or even death.
Sadly, Pewter is also the fastest-burning of the common metals
### Rules
While burning Pewter, you may add your Pewter rating to your Physique score, which in turn increases your Health (though again, only as long as you burn the metal). Should your Health drop to 0 when you stop burning Pewter, you immediately fall unconscious or begin dying, as determined by the Narrator based on your physical state and any injuries you’ve sustained.
Burning Pewter also lets you run at speeds up to 25 mph — fast enough to automatically outrun any normal human — though prolonged exertion of this nature runs the risk of a Pewter drag (see next).
Finally, your healing rate is doubled — from 1 recovered Health to 2 — ­during any day when you burn Pewter for 8 hours or more.
#### Pewter Drags
If you exert yourself for eight or more hours while burning Pewter, you suffer from Pewter drag unless you continue to burn Pewter while resting for another eight hours. Pewter drag prevents you from burning Pewter and drops your Physique score to one-half normal, rounded down. This reduces your Health accordingly, and if your Health drops to 0 as a result you immediately begin dying (see page 183).
### Burn Rate
Pewter burns swiftly, each charge lasting only 5 minutes. When flared, Pewter burns at a rate of 30 seconds per charge.
### Flaring
In addition to increasing your Pewter rating by 1 (which consequently increases your Physique score and Health by 1 each), flaring this metal also lessens the severity of a single Physical Burden by one degree (a ­Mortal Burden becomes Grave, a Grave Burden becomes Serious, or a Serious Burden is lost).
### Stunts
#### Denser Tissues
While burning Pewter, your flesh becomes tougher and denser, and you suffer 1 less damage from physical attacks. You may take this Stunt a second time, reducing the damage you suffer from physical attacks by 1 more (for a maximum total of 2).
#### Extreme Speed
You can run as fast as a galloping race horse (approximately 40 mph). During each Beat, you may take up to 2 steps toward or away from a target without penalty, or you may choose not to gain any Action or Defense dice for the round to take 3 steps toward or away from a target.
#### Inhuman Endurance (Trait)
You may exert yourself for a number of days up to your Pewter rating without suffering Pewter drag. In addition to its story implications and descriptive applications, this Stunt grants the “Inhuman ­Endurance” Trait while you’re burning or flaring Pewter.
#### Prodigious Strength
While burning Pewter, you add an additional die with Physique rolls involving physical strength, including lifting and moving objects, and wielding heavy weapons. You may take this Stunt twice.
#### Unconscious Burning
You automatically burn Pewter when unconscious, though only if also injured (i.e. you don’t automatically burn Pewter when ­sleeping). Each Pewter charge burned in this fashion lasts for three hours, and the only benefits it conveys are increased Health, accelerated healing, and avoiding Pewter drag. It has no effect on Physique rolls or dice pools. This special Pewter burn stops immediately when you regain consciousness.
### Savants
A Pewterarm Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Pewter rolls, but is also so accustomed to his or her Allomantically fueled abilities that lethargy sets in without them. When not burning Pewter, the Savant’s Physique score drops by 1 (to a minimum of 2).
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Pewter to store physical strength. Tapping a pewtermind can grant incredible ability, like ­throwing a fully loaded packhorse several ­hundred feet or ­ripping down the reinforced metal gates of a fortress. ­However, a ­Feruchemist grows physically weak when ­storing, his muscles temporarily shrinking and withering.
### Storing
While storing, you lose 1 die per charge ­currently being stored with rolls involving physical strength (like Physique rolls to ­attack with a melee weapon, to lift something heavy, or to hold something aloft). Note this storing does not affect your Health — only your physical might. The ­maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Pewter rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with rolls you make involving physical strength. As with storing, tapping strength does not increase your Health (that’s what Gold does).
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of strength can lift amazing amounts of weight, tear steel with their bare hands, and topple creatures much larger than themselves. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Pewter include:

| Charges Tapped | Examples                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | Lift and carry a large person in full armor; kick in an average wooden door                                             |
| 20             | Lift and carry a horse; kick in a reinforced wooden door                                                                |
| 30             | Lift and carry a large, fully-loaded wagon; throw a horse at least 10 yards; rip a reinforced metal door off its hinges |
| 60             | Rip off Luthadel’s iron gates; throw a fully loaded wagon 100 yards                                                     |
| 90             | Rip a large hole in Luthadel’s stone walls; throw Luthadel’s iron gates 100 yards                                       |
## Hemalurgy
### Spike
Costs 2 x the Feruchemy rating gained in [[Advancements]]
Depending on where a Pewter spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Feruchemical Power derived from any one of the four Physical Metals (e.g. the ability to store or tap physical strength, senses, speed, or weight). Each spike may store only one Power. Pewter Spikes: A Pewter spike grants you a single Feruchemical Power — Tin, Pewter, Iron, or Steel — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit score by 1, as normal.
# Iron
Iron is one of the most common and easily acquired metals in the Final Empire. In all three traditions it grants powers related to weight — by Pulling metal, controlling one’s own weight, or stealing muscle mass.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Iron is called a Lurcher.
Burning Iron lets an Allomancer physically Pull on metals within several dozen yards. While burning Iron, a character sees bright, transparent blue lines leading from his or her center of mass and leading out to all sources of metal within range; the further away an object is from the character, the fainter the blue lines. The character may Pull on any metal objects sensed in this fashion, and this process is commonly called “Ironpulling.” By varying the strength and speed of an Ironpull, a character may affect objects of various sizes, and also control their velocity. A skilled Pull can drag a coin slowly across a surface or hurl a metal urn at speeds approaching that of an arrow.
There are several limitations to this ability. First, objects are Pulled directly towards the character’s center of mass, which is good when drawing a weapon to hand but not as helpful when others are blocking the character’s line of sight to it. Strategic Pullers might use this to their advantage, Pulling a weapon (or another object) that’s situated on the other side of an opponent, turning it into a ranged weapon. This is great until the character misses, at which point he or she becomesa target of the very same missile. Many Ironpullers carry wooden shields for this very reason.
Additionally, the weight an Allomancer can move using Iron depends upon his or her own — Pulling an object that weighs as much as the character results in a pointless tug of war, while Pulling something heavier, or something anchored down in some fashion that would support the character’s weight, moves the character toward the object instead. Thus, Pulling the lock of a sturdy door would draw the character toward the door, unless the surrounding wall were somehow unstable enough that it wouldn’t support the character’s weight. Allomancers often anchor themselves by Pulling on a second larger object, or increasing their weight. Creative characters use this to maneuver, Pulling themselves up toward anchored objects and using others to guide their trajectories through the air. Careful “Pulling” can even work like relaxing a muscle, letting the character slowly drop from a metal fixture at the top of a high structure or sliding down a steep incline topped with an anchored metal object. Burning Iron can even let a character hover in midair below a sufficiently secured mooring, like a metal chain holding up a large chandelier, or the metal binding around a wooden rafter.
One last restriction: virtually no Allomancer can Pull on metal that’s inside a person, or that’s driven through a body, like metal earrings or Hemalurgic spikes. The only exceptions are through Allomantic enhancements, as provided by Duralumin or Nicrosil.
### Rules
While burning Iron, you automatically detect and may Pull either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Pull more than one object unless you Pull all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt (see page 306).
If a Pulled object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s drawn toward you; otherwise, you’re Pulled towards it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Ironpulling requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Iron rating.
A common use of Ironpulling is to attack with loose metal objects behind an enemy. When you make such an attack, you roll with your Iron rating and apply the other rules listed here:

| Object                            | Damage | Min/Max Range     |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Small metal object (e.g. coin)    | +1     | Striking / Medium |
| Medium metal object (e.g. weapon) | +2     | Striking / Medium |
| Large metal object (e.g. scenery) | +3     | Close / Medium    |
Pulling an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Iron and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Iron vs. his or her Iron. In both cases, success drags the object away from the target (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn).
#### Reactions
You may also Pull metal objects in motion (such as steel-headed arrows, coins, and other thrown metal objects), potentially redirecting their flight. In combat this is a reaction to an attack, and if your Iron Result beats the attacker’s Result, you may adjust the object’s trajectory enough that it either misses the original target or flies toward you instead (your choice). If you Pull the object toward yourself, you may spend 2 Nudges to catch it. In combat, you may only Pull an object in motion once per Beat. 
####  Pulling Extremely Heavy Objects
Anchored Pulling can put great stress on an Allomancer’s body. Each time you Pull on two or more extremely heavy objects — for example, anchoring yourself to the metal on a building while tearing a metal gate from its hinges — you lose 1 Health from physical strain.
#### Pulling Objects in Bodies
Pulling metal objects from a body (such as piercings and Hemalurgic spikes) is exceedingly difficult, requiring a successful Contest of your Iron vs. your target’s Physique with an Outcome of 5 or greater. This is normally only possible if your Iron is boosted with Duralumin (see page 341) or you enjoy a Nicroburst (see page 349).
### Burn Rate
Iron burns at a rate of one charge every 20 minutes. When flared, Iron burns at 2 minutes per charge
### Flaring
Flaring Iron provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Iron rating.
### Stunts
#### Improved Redirection
You gain 1 “free” die when reacting with Iron (see above). You may take this Stunt one additional time, increasing your “free” dice to 2.
#### Increased Velocity
You may Pull objects at a velocity of up to 250 mph, and the damage they inflict increases by +1.
#### Ironslide
You may Pull yourself at a heavy object at breakneck speed. During each Beat, you may Ironpull to take up to 2 steps toward or away from a target without penalty, or you may choose not to gain any Action or Defense dice for the round to take 3 steps toward or away from a target.
#### Long Range
You detect and may Pull metal objects out to 300 paces (Long Range).
#### Multiple Targets
You have finer control of your Ironpulling, and may simultaneously Pull a number of individual metal objects up to your Iron rating.
### Savants
A Lurcher Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Iron rolls, but is also very connected to the surrounding world, losing a bit of perspective. When not burning Iron, the Savant’s Willpower drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Iron to store weight, becoming exceptionally light for a time. This allows them to jump further than normal or to fall slowly and with less risk. Tapping weight increases the density and durability of the character’s body, letting him or her more easily withstand falls and similar stresses. Tapping extreme weight can let a character crush obstacles or break through floors. This versatility makes Iron one of the few metals that’s as useful when storing as when tapping.
### Storing
When storing, your body weight drops by roughly 10% per charge currently being stored. As usual, you cannot store more of something than you have, so this means that the maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Iron rating or 9 (reducing your weight by roughly 90%), whichever is lower.
Also while storing, it’s easier to jump and climb, and you suffer less ­damage from falls. For every two charges being stored, you gain one die with Physique rolls to jump or climb, and damage from falling drops by 1 (i.e. when storing four charges of weight, you gain two dice with these rolls and suffer 2 less ­damage from falls). However, other characters gain the same number of dice when attempting to grapple or throw you, or for any other activity that pits their weight against yours.
You may only store your own weight in an ironmind; the weight of any ­objects you carry or wear may never be stored, and in fact if their combined weight is ever greater than yours, you become pinned and may not move.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, your increases by roughly 10%. There is no upper limit to the amount of weight you may gain in this way, but cautious Feruchemists keep in mind that weak and thin surfaces can easily give way if they go too far...
Jumping and climbing are also affected by tapping. For every two charges tapped, you lose one die with Physique rolls to jump or climb, and opponents lose  one die with rolls to grapple or throw you, or for any other activity that pits their weight against yours. Thus, tapping ten charges reduces your pool by 5 dice when jumping or climbing, and your opponents’ pools by the same amount when grappling or throwing you, or performing similar actions.
Characters often increase their weight with Iron to make themselves an anchor when Ironpulling or Steelpushing.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of weight can land heavy blows (by dropping their fists or bodies onto targets). They can also shatter surfaces and grind runaway vehicles to a halt. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Iron include:

| Charges Tapped | Weight Increases and Other Examples                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | 5 × normal weight; stop a man in his tracks; inflict +1 damage with physical attacks                                                    |
| 20             | 10 × normal weight; stop a horse in its tracks; break through a thick glass floor; inflict +2 damage with physical attacks              |
| 30             | 20 × normal weight; stop an empty wagon in its tracks; break through a wooden floor; inflict +3 damage with physical attacks            |
| 40             | 50 × normal weight; stop an armored or full vehicle in its tracks; break through a stone floor; inflict +4 damage with physical attacks |
| 50             | 100 × normal weight; stop a huge rolling boulder its tracks; break through a metal floor; inflict +5 damage with physical attacks       |
## Hemalurgy
Iron spikes store human strength. Four of them, each having stolen the strength of a separate person, are used to make the inhuman koloss. Indeed, Iron spikes are rarely used for any other purpose, as they take a great toll on the mind and spirit. Even one causes the recipient’s body to swell to inhuman proportions, and dramatically dulls his or her mind. Additional spikes continue to warp the recipient, until eventually all memory is lost, leaving nothing behind but a bestial creature driven by rage and hunger.
Despite this, Iron spikes are the second most common Blessing granted to kandra, enhancing their physical speed and strength similar to that of a Pewterarm.
### Spikes
Costs 4 [[Advancements]]
The first Iron spike adds 2 dice with rolls involving physical strength, and each subsequent spike adds 1 die with these rolls. However, both your Charm and Spirit scores drop by 1 for each Iron spike you receive (rather than just your Spirit). Iron spikes also make your body swell in size and become exceptionally muscular, and multiple spikes tint your skin with blue. Any character with four or more Iron spikes is transformed into a koloss, losing memory and self-control (and becoming a Villain under the Narrator’s control).
### Blessings
The Blessing of Potency increases your Physique score by 2, to a maximum of 8.
# Steel
Steel is the alloy of iron and carbon, easily found in nearly any Dominance. It provides a variety of powerful benefits to practitioners of all three magical traditions.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Steel is called a Coinshot.
Burning Steel grants abilities very similar to those of Iron, with one key difference — the metal lets an Allomancer Push metal within several dozen yards directly away, rather than Pulling them in. This process is typically called “Steelpushing.” A character burning Steel also sees transparent blue lines leading from his center of mass out to every piece of metal within range, and their intensity is likewise based on their distance and size. Pushing along these lines lets the character send an unanchored object of equal or smaller weight away, or sends him or her in the other direction from an anchored or larger object. Allomancers often use this ability to fire small objects like coins at targets (hence the Misting nickname). This makes Steel the most popular form of offensive Allomancy, and puts Coinshots in high demand among noble houses and military forces alike.
Pushing against anchored or larger metal objects (or smaller objects on the ground directly below the character) is a favorite mode of Allomantic travel. By dropping a coin or two on the ground and Pushing against them, a skilled Allomancer can “walk” on stilts of Allomantic force, or hover dozens of yards in theair. In the early days of the Final Empire, Allomantic highways were comprised of metal bars wedged into the ground, providing Allomancers with quick and reliable travel between Luthadel and other major cities. Of course, landing can be difficult, so many leave such stunts to Mistborn (who can absorb the punishment of any mishap with Pewter).
As with Iron, Pushing on metal inside or piercing the body of another ­living being (like piercings and Hemalurgic spikes) is exceedingly difficult, and ­typically only achievable when also using an enhancement metal like Duralumin or Nicrosil.
### Rules
While burning Steel, you automatically detect and may Push either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Push more than one object unless you Push all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt (see right).
If a Pushed object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s propelled away from you; otherwise, you’re Pushed away from it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Steelpushing requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Steel rating.
A common use of Steelpushing is to attack with loose metal objects between you and an enemy (e.g. the contents of a coin purse or a bag of horseshoes, which you can throw at an opponent as part of an attack). When you make such an ­attack, you roll with your Steel rating and apply the other rules listed here: 

| Object                            | Damage | Min / Max Range   |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Small metal object (e.g. coin)    | +1     | Striking / Medium |
| Medium metal object (e.g. weapon) | +2     | Striking / Medium |
| Large metal object (e.g. scenery) | +3     | Close / Medium    |
Pushing an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Steel and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another ­Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Steel vs. his or her Steel. In both cases, success propels the object out of the target’s hands and away from you (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn). In the case of a metal object positioned between two Steelpushing Allomancers, the object can become a projectile targeting the loser, using the rules on the Steelpushing Attacks table (see above).
Finally, by Pushing off of metal in your environment, or metallic implements on the ground like coins or horseshoes, you may hover in midair, or “stilt-walk” or sail at up to 25 miles per hour. This is not flight, and the maximum height you can reach is equal to your Pushing range (100 paces, unless you have the Long Range Stunt). Landing can also be problematic, requiring you to Push off of metal objects thrown down onto the ground or already located there. Most landings require no roll but doing so in rough or treacherous terrain requires a successful Steel 1 roll, with failure costing you 1 Health.
#### Reactions
You may also Push metal objects in motion (such as steel-headed arrows, coins, and other thrown metal objects), potentially ­redirecting their flight. In combat this is a reaction to an attack, and if your Steel Result beats the attacker’s Result, you may adjust the object’s trajectory enough that it misses and flies away from you instead.
#### Pushing Extremely Heavy Objects
Anchored Pushing can put great stress on an Allomancer’s body. Each time you Push on two or more extremely heavy objects — for example, Pushing between a locked steel gate and an armored wagon to break open the first, flip over the second, or both — you lose 1 Health from physical strain.
#### Pulling Objects in Bodies
Pushing metal objects in a body (such as ­piercings and Hemalurgic spikes) is exceedingly difficult, requiring a successful Contest of your Steel vs. your target’s Physique with an Outcome of 5 or greater. This is normally only possible if your Steel is boosted with Duralumin (see page 341) or you enjoy a Nicroburst (see page 349).
### Burn Rate
Steel burns at a rate of one charge every 20 minutes. When flared, Steel burns at 2 minutes per charge.
### Flaring Steel
Flaring Steel provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Steel rating.
### Stunts
#### Increased Velocity
You may Push objects at a velocity of up to 250 mph, and the damage they inflict increases by +1.
#### Long Range
You detect and may Push metal objects out to 300 paces (Long Range).
#### Multiple Targets
You have finer control of your Steelpushing, and may ­simultaneously Push a number of individual metal objects up to your Steel rating.
#### Reflect Ranged Attack
When reacting with Steel, you can Push a ranged attack targeting you toward a different target within range (as opposed to merely away from you and toward nothing in particular). This requires you to win the Contest and spend 2 Nudges; winning the Contest with less than 2 Nudges does not allow you to reflect the attack. No matter how many Nudges you spend, you may not reflect the attack toward the attacker.
#### Steel Running
By Pushing off the metals in your environment, you can move as fast as a galloping race horse (approximately 40 mph). During each Beat, you may Steelpush to take up to 2 steps toward or away from a target without penalty, or you may choose not to gain any Action or Defense dice for the round to take 3 steps toward or away from a target.
### Savants
A Coinshot Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Steel rolls, but is also very accustomed to directly influencing the surrounding world, and often grows overconfident as a result. When not burning Steel, the Savant’s Willpower drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Steel to store physical speed, ­becoming sluggish and almost lethargic. Conversely, tapping speed ­accelerates reaction time and lets the character run faster than a human, a galloping horse, or even a skilled Allomancer ­burning Pewter. Tapping extreme speed can let a character perform ­seemingly impossible feats of alacrity, like running from one end of Luthadel to the other in under a minute.
### Storing
When storing, your reflexes and movement speed are diminished and you lose 1 die per charge currently being stored with Physique rolls involving physical speed or reaction time. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Steel rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower.
Also while storing in a Conflict, any physical action produces 1 fewer ­Action Dice per charge currently being stored. Thus, a melee attack that would normally create a pool of 5 Action Dice produces only 2 Action Dice while storing 3 charges in a steelmind.
Finally, when storing any amount of speed in a steelmind during combat, you may only move by choosing to receive no Action or Defense Dice at all, and even then you may only take 1 step toward or away from an opponent.
### Tapping
Each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with Physique rolls involving physical speed or reaction time. Also, when you tap speed to support a physical action during a Conflict, you gain 1 additional Action Die per charge tapped (e.g. tapping 4 charges of speed to support a melee attack grants you 4 additional Action Dice for the round).
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of physical speed can become a blur, too fast for the naked eye to see. They zip through battlefields like angry winds, cutting enemies down and darting to new foes before anyone can make out their positions.
Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Steel include:

| Charges Tapped | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | Your running speed increases to 25 mph; you can take 2 steps toward or away from anything in a single Beat if you take an action, or may instead choose to receive no dice at all to take 3 steps  |
| 20             | Your running speed increases to 50 mph; you can take 3 steps toward or away from anything in a single Beat if you take an action, or may instead choose to receive no dice at all to take 4 steps  |
| 30             | Your running speed increases to 100 mph; you can take 4 steps toward or away from anything in a single Beat if you take an action, or may instead choose to receive no dice at all to take 5 steps |
| 40             | Your running speed increases to 150 mph; you can take 5 steps toward or away from anything in a single Beat if you take an action, or may instead choose to receive no dice at all to take 6 steps |
| 50             | Your running speed increases to 200 mph; you can take 6 steps toward or away from anything in a single Beat                                                                                        |
## Hemalurgy
Steel spikes are a basic component for creating Steel Inquisitors. Depending on where the spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Allomantic Power derived from any one of the four Physical Metals (e.g. increasing senses, improving physical fitness, or Pulling or Pushing metal objects). Each spike may store only one Power.
### Spikes
Costs 2 x the Allomancy rating gained in [[Advancements]]
A Steel spike grants you a single Allomantic Power — Tin, Pewter, Iron, or Steel — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit score by 1, as normal.
# Copper
Copper is very common and inexpensive. It’s a source of protection in all three magical disciplines, whether it’s guarding Allomancers from detection or preserving memories and knowledge.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Copper is called a Coppercloud or Smoker.
Copper has two Allomantic applications. It’s primarily used to dampen signs of Allomancy within a radius of several dozen feet (an area that’s also called a “coppercloud”), within which the Smoker and those nearby are obfuscated from detection by Allomancers burning Bronze. As soon as the character starts burning Copper, all signs of Allomancy within the cloud’s range instantly “vanish” from Bronze burners — including any Bronze burners in the same area. This makes a Copper burner an essential addition to any crew employing Allomancers — without concealing the pulses every Allomancer gives off while burning metal, the team is easily detected by rival Seekers, Mistborn, and Steel Inquisitors.
A second useful effect of burning Copper is that it renders the character virtually immune to Allomantic emotional manipulation. This makes a Copper burner useful for negotiation, investigation, and as an informant or spy, as he or she is nearly impossible to detect as an Allomancer, and not easily influenced by Soothers or Rioters. 
### Rules
While burning Copper, you emit a coppercloud out to 10 paces in all directions (Close Range). To detect Allomancy within your coppercloud, a character must have a Bronze rating at least 2 higher than your Copper rating and must succeed with a Bronze 5 roll; otherwise your Allomantic abilities and those of other characters in your cloud are invisible to Allomantic senses. For this reason, the best way to potentially pierce a coppercloud is by combining Hemalurgic Bronze with a pre-existing Bronze rating (see page 322). 
Additionally, you’re highly resistant to the effects of emotional (Brass and Zinc) Allomancy while burning Copper. Any character using either of these metals against you loses a number of dice equal to your Copper rating with the attempt (i.e. with their Brass or Zinc roll), and if this reduces their pool to less than two dice, the attempt is impossible — you’re simply immune to their emotional tampering.
### Burn Rate
Copper burns at a rate of one charge every 40 minutes. When flared, Copper burns at a rate of 4 minutes per charge.
### Flaring
Flaring Copper provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Copper rating. Still, flaring Copper is quite useful when you’re facing a powerful Seeker...
### Stunts
#### Extend Mental Protection
All characters in your coppercloud benefit from the same resistance you have to emotional Allomancy.
#### Increased Mental Protection
A character who uses emotional (Brass or Zinc) Allomancy against you loses a number of dice equal to your Copper rating plus 2, rather than equal to your Copper rating.
#### Iron Will
While burning Copper, you ignore 1 point of Willpower damage from each successful attack. You may take this Stunt one additional time, increasing the Willpower damage you ignore to 2.
#### Larger Coppercloud
Your coppercloud extends out to 100 paces in all directions (Medium Range).
### Savants
A Smoker Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Copper rolls and is a rare case of a Misting being largely unaffected by continuous burning. Consequently, the Savant suffers no penalties when not burning Steel.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Copper to store memories, indefinitely and with perfect accuracy and clarity. This of course makes them a vital commodity in the information-starved Final Empire.
While storing memorized knowledge or events, a character has only a faint recollection of them — much like a fading dream. This is often done to keep information “fresh,” committing a memory to a coppermind as soon as it’s no longer immediately useful as possible, so it can be retrieved later without having to rely on the tenuous nature of the mind. Cagey characters sometimes store damaging secrets as well — because what need is there to lie when you genuinely can’t remember something?
Tapping memories lets a Feruchemist “check out” that information, like someone in our world would check out a library book. He or she recalls it precisely and with perfect clarity, as if via photographic memory, and can describe it without issue. For example, a character recalling a book could duplicate it exactly, word for word. However, this process does not improve the accuracy of the information recalled — a character who was mistaken about a person’s name still remembers it incorrectly, and because the memory is stored in a perfect and unaltered (and unalterable) the character’s impression never changes, even after countless corrections from trusted friends.
The massive wealth of information stored can be difficult to track, and so many Feruchemists organize memories into different copperminds and keep detailed indices of what’s contained in each. Others reread books they’ve stored and write down rough details of their stored knowledge to use as reference when tapping their copperminds. In many ways this reinforces the library analogy, as the cracks in the system aren’t so much about the recorded information as one’s access and perception of it.
The greatest peril for a Feruchemist is that one or more copperminds are lost or destroyed, as this means the memories held within are gone for good. For some characters this vulnerability is a blessing, providing an opportunity few can indulge — the chance to selectively and permanently forget painful or troubling memories — but to most it’s a desperate danger. The chance that such a prized possession might disappear forever, denying not only a life’s work but a life’s most personal legacy... It’s a terrifying proposition most Feruchemists guard against with their very lives.
### Storing
While storing memory, each charge represents one piece of useful and important information (like the location of a vital object or a Secret relevant to the current story), or one learned Trait (such as a profession, skill, or bit of training). The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Copper rating or your Wits score minus 1, whichever is lower.
Unlike most Feruchemical storage, memory does not reset when the process is complete. Stored memories remain lost until tapped, and only return while tapped; at all other times those memories are simply gone. They may not be dredged up, even under duress.
The Narrator always has final say as to what information qualifies for storing in a coppermind.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you regain one lost (stored) piece of information or learned Trait, recalling it with perfect clarity and accuracy (though any flaws in the information or Trait still apply, exactly, only, and always as they did when the memory was first stored).
As these memories are indelible, they don’t provide more than an accurate recollection of what was witnessed or occurred, but in tandem they can be quite powerful. Thus, for every two charges you tap you gain 1 die that may be added to any pool for a task related to or supported by the regained memory or Trait. 
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of memory can access far more than a handful of moments, simultaneously gaining a full and perfect view of whole days, weeks, or much, much wider periods of time. Many Feruchemists, including the renegade Keepers, recall and verbally pass along their memories and learned Traits to keep their knowledge alive long after they’re gone, making this the only way to access the vast swaths of information available to some Feruchemists. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Copper include:

| Charges Tapped | What you recall in entirety (all at once) with perfect clarity |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | hour                                                           |

## Hemalurgy
Copper spikes store intelligence and memory. They’re very rarely used on humans due to the terrible dementia and frequent insanity produced as shards of a stored soul shred a recipient’s mind.
Kandra with the Blessing of Presence sport a pair of copper spikes, which sharpen their mind without mental instability.
### Spike
Costs 4 Advancements
A Copper spike increases your Wits score by 1, to a maximum of 10. However, both your Charm and Spirit scores drop by 1 for each Copper spike you receive (rather than just your Spirit). Additionally, you may hear voices or recall memories that seem familiar yet oddly alien. This effect is especially common when you encounter pieces of the life left behind by the spike’s original victim.
### Blessings
The Blessing of Presence grants enhanced intelligence and memory, increasing your Wits score by 2, to a maximum of 8.
# Bronze
Bronze is the alloy of copper and tin, and common throughout the Empire. It’s used in all three disciplines and offers sublime awareness of the surrounding world.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Bronze is called a Seeker. Burning Bronze allows an Allomancer to detect nearby use of Allomancy. The burning metals are sensed as a ­pattern of vibrations or pulses, not unlike a drumbeat. By default it’s fine-tuned enough that the character can track multiple ­Allomancers within range, and distinguish the types of metals each is burning by distinguishing the distinct rhythm of each.
Unlike most senses Bronze isn’t impeded by physical barriers or other ­sensory input, which means a Bronze-burner can detect Allomancy even through solid stone walls, crowds, and total darkness. In fact, the character can sense ­burning metals even if the Allomancer burning them isn’t readily apparent in any other way (via line of sight, for example, or any noises he or she is making). The only ways to evade a Bronze-burner’s detection is by burning Copper, moving out of range, or ceasing to burn all metals of one’s own.
Though Bronze is considered a weak metal by some crews, characters who can burn it are favorite recruits of the Steel Ministry, which employs them to hunt down skaa Mistings. Skilled Bronze-burners often become Steel Inquisitors, as combining their ability with a Bronze spike lets them detect Allomantic activity even when it’s concealed within a coppercloud (see page 315).
### Rules
By concentrating while burning Bronze (taking no other actions and paying no attention to your immediate physical surroundings), you detect all ­Allomantic activity within 100 paces (Medium Range). You detect both the number of ­Allomancers burning metal within this range, and which metals each is ­burning. This detection penetrates all surfaces and areas within range, save for those ­concealed by the effects of burning Copper, an area otherwise known as a ­coppercloud (see page 315).
Piercing a coppercloud is quite difficult, and typically the exclusive purview of extremely powerful Seekers and those enhanced with Hemalurgy. To pierce a Smoker’s coppercloud, your Bronze rating must be at least 2 higher than the Copper rating of the Smoker producing the cloud and you must succeed with a Bronze 5 roll. With success, you detect one Allomancer inside the cloud, plus one additional Allomancer per Nudge spent. Neither success nor failure alerts the Copper-burner to your detection.
You may also roll Bronze to learn how a single detected Allomancer is ­using his or her Power (if you want to learn this information about more than one ­Allomancer, you must roll separately per Allomancer, per question you have about them). The Difficulty of this roll depends on the information you’re trying to learn:

| Difficulty | Example of Information Desired                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Simple (e.g. the number of dice in the Allomancer’s last pool using a Power)<br>                                                                        |
| 2          | Basic (e.g. which metals the Allomancer is flaring, if any)<br>                                                                                         |
| 3          | Detailed (e.g. any Stunts the Allomancer is using)<br>                                                                                                  |
| 4          | Specific (e.g. the target(s) of the Allomancer’s Power, such as the character being Rioted or Soothed, or the metal sources being Pulled or Pushed)<br> |
| 5          | Exacting (e.g. the Allomancer’s remaining charges with each metal currently being burned)<br>                                                           |

### Burn Rate
Bronze burns at a rate of one charge every 30 minutes, or one charge every 3 minutes while flared.
### Flaring
Flaring Bronze provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Bronze rating.
### Stunts
#### Broad Seeking
When rolling Bronze to learn how a detected Allomancer is using his or her Power, your standard option (ask a single question about one Allomancer to determine a Difficulty) is replaced with two new ones:
- You may simply roll targeting any one detected Allomancer without asking a question, learning everything that your Result allows (i.e. with a Result of 4, you learn all simple, basic, detailed, and specific information about that one Allomancer).
- You may alternately ask one question about all Allomancers in range, and with success against that question’s Difficulty you learn the answer about all of them (e.g. if you sensed three Allomancers in range, you could ask what Stunts they’re using and with a Bronze Result of 3 or higher you would learn that information about all three of them).
#### Increased Range
Your detection range increases from 100 paces (Medium Range) to 300 paces (Long Range). You may take this Stunt a second time, e­ xtending your range to 1,000 paces (Extreme Range).
#### Subconscious Seeking
While burning Bronze, you detect Allomantic ­activity within range without having to concentrate, which lets you take other actions at the same time and, as any other actions allow, perceive your immediate physical surroundings as normal.
### Savants
A Seeker Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Bronze rolls and is also among the least affected by continuous burning. Consequently, the Savant suffers no penalties when not burning Bronze.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Bronze to store wakefulness, during which they become drowsy. Storing enough wakefulness can send a Feruchemist into a trance-like state that can only be disrupted by violent changes in his or her ­immediate e­nvironment. This state isn’t true sleep, and the Feruchemist comes out of it ­neither more rested nor more tired.
Tapping a bronzemind makes a Feruchemist highly alert and aware, and can keep him or her awake for days on end, without the need for sleep and without subsequent sleep debt. Feruchemists also tap large amounts of wakefulness to throw off the effects of drugs or intoxication, and to dramatically heighten their awareness.
### Storing
While storing wakefulness, you lose a die per change currently being stored with Physique rolls involving endurance and Wits rolls involving awareness. Additionally, your Wits score is considered 1 lower per charge currently being stored for the purpose of declaring actions in a Conflict (see page 172). The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Bronze rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with ­Physique rolls involving endurance and Wits rolls involving awareness, and your Wits score is considered 1 higher per charge tapped for the purpose of declaring actions in a Conflict (see page 172).
Additionally, you can stay awake without natural fatigue for 8 additional hours per charge tapped (so by tapping 5 charges you stay awake for an additional 40 hours beyond the traditional 16 anyone gets after a full night’s sleep). After this period you must sleep as normal, but you don’t require more than the usual six to eight hours’ shuteye to start fresh.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of wakefulness can stay awake for weeks at a time, or resist falling unconscious from injury. For every 10 charges tapped, you may stay awake for up to 1 week (168 hours) without normal fatigue. Alternately, when an injury would normally knock you unconscious, you may tap 10 or more charges of Bronze to continue acting for 1 minute per 10 charges tapped.
## Hemalurgy
Bronze spikes store Mental Allomantic Powers. The most common recipients of these spikes are Seekers-turned-Steel Inquisitors, who augment their own natural ability with stolen Bronze and use the mighty combination to pierce copperclouds. Depending on where the spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Allomantic Power derived from any one of the four Mental Metals (e.g. the ability to hide Allomantic use, detect Allomancy, Riot the emotions of others, or Soothe them). Each spike may store only one Power.
### Spikes
Costs 2 x Allomancy Rating in [[Advancements]]
A Bronze spike grants you a single Allomantic Power — Copper, Bronze, Zinc, or Brass — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit score by 1, as normal.
# Zinc
Zinc is a common and inexpensive metal, employed by every discipline. Its uses include intensifying emotion, stockpiling the speed of thought, and fortifying emotional resistance.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Zinc is called a Rioter.
Burning Zinc lets the Allomancer intensify the emotions of those nearby. Any or all emotions a target is already feeling may be magnified, though Zinc is most often used to amplify only a single emotion that the character feels will best serve his or her cause, like an opponent’s fear during a duel.
An Allomancer can’t use Zinc to create new feelings in a target, only pull their existing emotions to the fore. Someone who’s bored or annoyed by a performance couldn’t be made to genuinely enjoy the show, but Zinc could ratchet up the restlessness until he or she heckles the performer or walks out. 
Thus, a character will often seed an emotion before burning Zinc — by ­offering a strong enough bargain to promote greed, for example, or by ­appealing to an outraged person’s sense of fair play to promote calm. The stronger the ­emotion already is, the more effective Zinc can be in fueling its growth.
Zinc does not let a character detect emotions, and so burners of the metal are usually practiced students of the human condition. Careful observation and ­analysis of behavior are vital to successfully manipulating any target’s emotional state.
Likewise, Zinc Allomancy is not mind control — a Rioted emotion is still the target’s own, it’s just more powerful, and no matter how strongly the ­target feels something he or she is still guided by core principles, preferences, and ­predilections. As an example, enflaming one person’s anger might prompt them to start a bar brawl, while doing the same in someone else might result in them traded insults, stalking off in disgust, or even finding comfort at the bottom of a bottle.
Emotional Allomancy is a reality of House life, with most nobles (and all Obligators) on the lookout for possible Allomantic manipulation. Sudden, strong, or inappropriate mood shifts are telltale signs and often disregarded out of hand, just in case a Rioter or Soother is the cause. Some Allomancers use this to their advantage, tampering with an emotion they want the target to ignore. Others know the best way to achieve their goals is through subtlety and guile rather than brute force and zeal.
### Rules
While burning Zinc, you may amplify one or more existing emotions in a number of individuals up to your rating with the metal. You may only affect those within 10 paces (Close Range).
You may not use Zinc to detect emotions, but you may roll your Charm to do so. This is a Difficulty 1 Challenge if the target is unaware of your attempt (and therefore unable to conceal their feelings), or a Charm vs. Charm Contest if they’re aware and trying to conceal their state.
You may Riot any emotion(s) you like, but your efforts are most effective when a target emotion is already strong. Thus, the Difficulty of any Zinc roll to amplify an emotion is based on its current strength. When Rioting multiple emotions, your Difficulty is set by the weakest of them (i.e. you roll against the highest Difficulty of all the target emotions).

| Difficulty | Example of Information Desired                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Very strong (e.g. fondness for a current lover; fear of a life-threatening situation; anger toward the murderer of the target’s family; desire to seize a no-risk opportunity or tremendous payoff )<br> |
| 2          | Strong (e.g. fondness for an ex-lover; fear of a risky situation; anger toward an oppressive government; desire to seize an opportunity with low risk or a good payoff)<br>                              |
| 3          | Slight (e.g. fondness for a friend; fear of an common situation; anger toward an annoying person; desire to seize an opportunity with some risk or an average payoff)<br>                                |
| 4          | Weak (e.g. fondness for an old rival; fear of a safe situation; anger toward a friendly person; desire to seize an opportunity with little risk or a low payoff)<br>                                     |
| 5          | Virtually nonexistent (e.g. fondness for a bitter enemy; fear of a no-risk situation; anger toward a loved one; desire to seize an opportunity with no risk or payoff)<br>                               |
With success, the target emotion(s) swell and you gain one die per point of Outcome with Charm and Influence rolls against the victim, so long as you concentrate your attention on them and keep burning Zinc (see What’s the Outcome?, page 144).
With failure, the target emotion(s) aren’t stirred and the Narrator may spend two Complications to alert the target to your effort. Four Complications may be spent to identify you as the source of the manipulation (see Complications, page 149).
Remember that Zinc does not grant you control of a Rioted character — it merely pulls them in one direction or another as befits their personal motivations and impulses. It’s also not always one-sided — a target aware that you’re manipulating them can oppose your Zinc rolls with their Wits or Charm, as fits their approach (in the Narrator’s estimation).
You can also Riot discordant emotions — like pleasure in someone performing an unpleasant task, or guilt after a victory — and this can trip up or confuse the victim. When anyone within range succeeds with a Charm or Influence roll, you may react by rolling your Zinc against a Difficulty equal to his or her Result, and for each point of positive Outcome you score, the victim loses one die with their next action (to a maximum of their Result with the current roll). You can only use this ability once per Beat.
### Burn Rate
Zinc burns at a rate of 20 minutes per charge, or 2 minutes per charge when flared.
### Flaring
It’s impossible to conceal the effects of flared Zinc — your target is automatically aware of your manipulation — but doing so lets you use the metal offensively. It lets you batter your target with maddening or psychotic emotions, entering a Mental Conflict that pits your Zinc against his or her Spirit, and attacking his or her Willpower (see Emotional Allomancy, page 226). As rounds are won the target grows more and more hysterical until, when and if the Conflict is won, he or she flies into a virtually mindless state of frenzy.
### Stunts
#### Affect Crowd
While burning Zinc, you may simultaneously Riot a number of people up to 20 × your Zinc rating, though you lose 2 dice with all Zinc rolls when manipulating multiple characters at once (see page 223 for more information about crowds). You may not use this Stunt while flaring Zinc.
#### Enduring Emotions
Emotions you Riot linger for up to an hour after you stop focusing on the victim.
#### Focused Emotion
Choose one emotion when you gain this Stunt (e.g. love, lust, rage, etc.). Your Zinc rating increases by 1 when you Riot this emotion. You may take this Stunt any number of times, but only once per emotion.
#### Humiliating Hysteria
When flaring Zinc, you may attack Reputation instead of Willpower, with each round won representing the bad name your target acquires due to his or her erratic behavior, and ultimate victory representing everyone cutting the target off, at least for the time being.
#### Medium Range
You may Riot targets within 100 paces (Medium Range).
#### Tug Emotion
You subtly Riot nearly everyone around you when burning Zinc. At these times you gain one die with Charm rolls. You do not gain this bonus with any roll that also gains dice due to Rioted emotions (i.e. you may not stack this benefit with the basic use of Zinc).
### Savants
A Rioter Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Zinc rolls, but the constant burn also takes a toll on the body. When not burning Zinc, the Savant’s Health drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Zinc to store mental speed, during which their thoughts are muddled and slow, unable to keep up with the fast-moving world around them. Conversely, tapping mental speed accelerates thought to a point where the surrounding world seems to move in slow motion.
A Feruchemist tapping Zinc and Steel at the same time makes an amazingly effective bodyguard or duelist, sharp enough to spot every opening and fast enough to exploit each before it closes. 
### Storing
While storing mental speed, you lose 1 die per charge currently being stored with Charm and Wits rolls demanding a quick ­mental ­reaction, such as keeping up with banter, delivering funny lines, and ­anticipating danger. Additionally, your Wits score is considered 1 lower per charge currently being stored for the purpose of declaring actions in a Conflict (see page 172). The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Zinc ­rating or your Wits score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with Charm and Wits rolls demanding a quick mental reaction, and your Wits score is ­considered 1 higher per charge tapped for the purpose of declaring actions in a Conflict (see page 172).
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
Feruchemists who tap huge amounts of mental speed become hyper-aware of their surroundings, able to exploit the slightest opportunities with ease. For every 10 charges of mental speed you tap, you gain one “free” die with reactions and defense rolls made in a single Conflict. Thus, if you spend 20 charges at any point during a Conflict, you would gain 2 dice with reaction and defense rolls for the rest of that Conflict.
## Hemalurgy
Zinc spikes store emotional stability and fortitude, and like other Hemalurgic spikes that steal innate human qualities these twist and warp recipients, inside and out. 
These spikes are by far the rarest of kandra Blessings, as the emotional stability they produce renders the recipient resistant to Allomantic control (and thus, much more dangerous).
### Spike
Costs 4 [[Advancements]]
A Zinc spike increases your Willpower by 2, but also reduces your Charm score by 1 (rather than your Spirit, as normal).
### Blessing
The Blessing of Stability increases your Willpower by 5, and also
makes you immune to control by Brass Allomancy with any rating of 10 or lower.
# Brass
Brass is the alloy of copper and zinc, and common throughout the Empire. In the Metallurgic Arts, it represents control — of emotion, warmth, and the Mental Powers of Feruchemy.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Brass is called a Soother. By burning Brass, an Allomancer can dampen (or Soothe) emotions of others, pushing them down in much the same way a Rioter pulls them to the surface. The character can suppress one emotion or any number of them, and a skilled Brass-burner can achieve an effect very similar to that of Zinc, quashing all emotions beside those he or she wants the target to feel.
The limitations of Soothing are virtually identical to those of Rioting — the character can’t detect emotions, nor may he or she totally wipe them away. The results of calming an emotion can be almost as ­unpredictable as stirring it, and the most accomplished Brass-burners focus as much time honing their powers of observation as their control with the metal — often more, given the high likelihood of a target noticing the conspicuous absence of an emotion.
Allomancers burning Brass possess one little-known but very powerful ­advantage — with enough Soothing they can flush the emotions, and indeed the wills of beings like the koloss and kandra, seizing physical control of them. ­Hemalurgy weakens resistance to Allomantic emotional manipulation, and in creatures that were essentially created by the art, this vulnerability is severe enough that a sufficiently powerful Brass-burner can command the creature like a puppet. This weakness is one of the most closely guarded secrets of the kandra, and only a few outside the Steel Ministry are aware of it during the Lord Ruler’s reign.
### Rules
While burning Brass, you may suppress one or more existing emotions in a number of individuals up to your rating with the metal. You may only affect those within 10 paces (Close Range).
You may not use Brass to detect emotions, but you may roll your Charm to do so. This is a Difficulty 1 Challenge if the target is unaware of your attempt (and therefore unable to conceal their feelings), or a Charm vs. Charm Contest if they’re aware and trying to conceal their state.
You may Soothe any emotion(s) you like, but your efforts are most effective when a target emotion is already weak. Thus, the Difficulty of any Brass roll to suppress an emotion is based on its current strength. When Soothing multiple emotions, your Difficulty is set by the strongest of them (i.e. you roll against the highest Difficulty of all the target emotions).

| Difficulty | Strength of Soothed Emotion                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Virtually nonexistent (e.g. fondness for a bitter enemy; fear of a no-risk situation; anger toward a loved one; desire to seize an opportunity with no risk or payoff)<br>                              |
| 2          | Weak (e.g. fondness for an old rival; fear of a safe situation; anger toward a friendly person; desire to seize an opportunity with little risk or a low payoff)<br>                                    |
| 3          | Slight (e.g. fondness for a friend; fear of an common situation; anger toward an annoying person; desire to seize an opportunity with some risk or an average payoff)<br>                               |
| 4          | Strong (e.g. fondness for an ex-lover; fear of a risky situation; anger toward an oppressive government; desire to seize an opportunity with low risk or a good payoff)<br>                             |
| 5          | Very strong (e.g. fondness for a current lover; fear of a life-threatening situation; anger toward the murderer of the target’s family; desire to seize a no-risk opportunity or tremendous payoff)<br> |
With success, the target emotion(s) wane and you gain one die per point of Outcome with Charm and Influence rolls against the victim, so long as you concentrate your attention on them and keep burning Zinc (see What’s the Outcome?, page 144).
With failure, the target emotion(s) aren’t affected and the Narrator may spend two Complications to alert the target to your effort. Four Complications may be spent to identify you as the source of the manipulation (see Complications, page 149).
Remember that Brass does not grant you control of a Soothed ­character — it merely pushes them in one direction or another as befits their personal ­motivations and impulses. It’s also not always one-sided — a target aware that you’re ­manipulating them can oppose your Brass rolls with their Wits or Charm, as fits their approach (in the Narrator’s estimation).
You can also Soothe natural emotions — like pleasure in someone ­indulging an enjoyable task, or joy after a victory — and this can trip up or confuse the victim. When anyone within range succeeds with a Charm or Influence roll, you may react by rolling your Brass against a Difficulty equal to his or her Result, and for each point of positive Outcome you score, the victim loses one die with their next action (to a maximum of their Result with the current roll). You can only use this ability once per Beat.
Finally, you may use Brass to control koloss and kandra, provided you’re aware of their vulnerability to Soothing (see the sidebar on page 226 for more information about this option).
### Burn Rate
Brass burns at a rate of 20 minutes per charge, or 2 minutes per charge when flared.
### Flaring
It’s impossible to conceal the effects of flared Brass — your target is automatically aware of your manipulation — but doing so lets you use the metal offensively. It lets you quash the target’s emotions to the point of numbness and debilitating apathy, entering a Mental Conflict that pits your Brass against his or her Spirit, and attacking his or her Willpower (see Emotional Allomancy, page 226). As rounds are won the target grows more and more detached until, when and if the Conflict is won, he or she falls into a catatonic depression.
### Stunts
#### Affect Crowd
While burning Brass, you may simultaneously Soothe a number of people up to 20 × your Brass rating, though you lose 2 dice with all Brass rolls when manipulating multiple characters at once (see page 223 for more information about crowds). You may not use this Stunt while flaring Brass.
#### Enduring Emotions
Emotions you Soothe linger for up to an hour after you stop focusing on the victim.
#### Focused Emotion
Choose one emotion when you gain this Stunt (e.g. love, lust, rage, etc.). Your Brass rating increases by 1 when you Soothe this emotion. You may take this Stunt any number of times, but only once per emotion.
#### Medium Range
You may Soothe targets within 100 paces (Medium Range).
#### Push Emotion
You subtly Soothe nearly everyone around you when ­burning Brass. At these times you gain one die with Charm rolls. You do not gain this ­bonus with any roll that also gains dice due to Soothed emotions (i.e. you may not stack this benefit with the basic use of Brass).
### Controlling Koloss and Kandra
Allomantic control of koloss and kandra was once common knowledge, during the early days of the Empire... so common, in fact, that the Lord Ruler hid his koloss armies and the kandra sought protection through the First Contract. After a thousand years of suppression, however, only the Lord Ruler and his Steel Inquisitors are privy to the information. Occasionally a sufficiently strong Allomancer or particularly inquisitive scholar stumbles across the vulnerability, but any who exploit it quickly find themselves at the bad end of an obsidian axe or Hemalurgic spike.
Thus far, only koloss and kandra have exhibited this vulnerability. While Steel Inquisitors and others with spikes find themselves more vulnerable to Rioting and Soothing, their will can’t be overridden, even with the strongest of Allomantic Powers.
Seizing control of a koloss or kandra’s body involves flushing all emotions from the creature, beating its will into submission until it becomes as an automaton under the attacker’s control. This requires a Brass rating of 8 or higher, or the use of an enhancement metal like Duralumin or Nicrosil. Multiple characters may coordinate to seize control, and when they do their combined Brass ratings must be 8 or higher.
Likewise, one or more characters may attempt to seize control of multiple koloss at once, and when they do each character loses one die per five koloss targeted with Brass rolls made in the attempt.
Attempting to seize control of a koloss is a **Mental Conflict pitting Brass vs. Wits, and attacking the creature’s Willpower**. Multiple attackers working together use the best of their Results, as they would in a Contest (see Contests with Multiple Participants, page 157). If the koloss’ Willpower reaches 0, its conscious mind is suppressed and it falls under the complete control of the attacker(s) for 10 minutes, plus an additional 10 minutes per Nudge spent (only Nudges spent during the Conflict’s final roll count for this purpose). Thereafter, the creature must be dominated again for the control to continue.
Seizing control of a kandra is handled the same way, save that a Brass rating of 9 or higher is required; characters may not work in concert to seize control of kandra; each character may control no more than one kandra at a time; and the duration of control is only 1 minute, plus 1 additional minute per Nudge spent.
In both cases, the controlled creature may be commanded to perform any action, even one that will result in certain death, or one that betrays the creature’s loyalties or principles. Remember, however, that control of the creature’s body does not mean control of its consciousness — it’s aware of everything it’s commanded to do and will doubtless address any abuses when and if it regains control at a later time.
Another Allomancer can wrest away control of a dominated creature by winning a Contest of Brass vs. Brass. With success, they gain control of the creature for the duration set by your original Conflict victory.
### Savants
A Soother Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Brass rolls, but also spends so much time in his or her own mind that the body grows frail. When not burning Brass, the Savant’s Health drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Brass to store warmth, and as with Iron this process can often be as useful as tapping. It physically cools the character, which can be very helpful on a hot summer day, and storing enough warmth can even keep the character safe from burns. Tapping warmth heats up the Feruchemist, which is great for staving off frostbite or hypothermia.
### Storing
While storing warmth, your body temperature drops approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit per charge currently being stored. Additionally, you suffer 1 less damage per two charges currently being stored from fire and heat. This does not make you fireproof, nor does it protect you from smoke inhalation. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Brass rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower. You may only store your own warmth in a brassmind; your clothing and anything you carry is vulnerable to fire and heat as normal.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, your body temperature rises approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, you suffer 1 less damage per two charges tapped from ice and cold. This does not make you immune to cold, but it does prevent you from suffering injuries like frostbite or hypothermia. Also, no matter how hot you get you may not burn or ignite objects.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of warmth radiates heat like a furnace, melting nearby snow and ice, and even boiling water. For every 10 charges of warmth you tap, everyone within 10 paces (Close Range) suffers 1 less damage from ice and cold. Additionally, attacks you make against living creatures inflict +1 damage per 20 charges tapped, so long as you attack with your bare hands (or another exposed part of your body) and you can reach an exposed patch of your target’s skin.
## Hemalurgy
Depending on where a Brass spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Feruchemical Power derived from any one of the four Mental Metals (e.g. the ability to store or tap memories, wakefulness, mental speed, or warmth). Each spike may store only one Power.
### Spike\
Costs 2 x Feruchemy rating [[Advancements]]
A Brass spike grants you a single Feruchemical Power — Copper, Bronze, Zinc, or Brass — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit by 1, as normal.
# Aluminum
Aluminum is difficult to refine without electricity or industrial technology, making it considerably more valuable than Gold during the Final Empire and King Elend’s reign. The metal’s scarcity also lets the Lord Ruler and his Inquisition keep its properties secret from all but a select few, and even trained metallurists can only afford to create tiny quantities at a time.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Aluminum is called an Aluminum Gnat. Due to the peculiar potential of this metal, this hapless Allomancer gains no benefit from his
or her “ability.”
Burning Aluminum instantly burns (consumes) all other metal stored in the Allomancer’s system. This is only useful for Mistborn and Hemalurgists who can burn both Aluminum and another metal.
Since Aluminum destroys stored metal, it’s primarily fed to captured ­Mistborn to render them helpless. However, as an Allomancer can’t be forced to ­involuntarily burn metal, this tactic generally involves threats or trickery (“Hey, try this vial of iron shavings!”).
### Rules
The instant a Mistborn burns Aluminum, all Allomantic metal charges in his system (including Aluminum) are burned and lost, rendering him or her powerless until more metal is consumed.
Because Aluminum burns instantly and no Mistings can practice with it, there are no benefits for flaring the metal or becoming an Aluminum Savant.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Aluminum to store personal i­dentity, in a process that’s both complex and awkward; while storing, the character becomes bland, indecisive, mildly forgetful, and emotionally pliable — ­essentially, less defined and distinct as an individual. ­Nothing ­fundamentally changes about the character but those things that make up his or her place in the world — tastes, opinions, loyalties, and the like — become much more flexible.
Tapping stored identity makes the Feruchemist a more fully realized ­version of him or herself, reinforcing deeply-held convictions and allegiances, and ­dramatically boosting self-worth. The character becomes resistant to ­brainwashing and manipulation, including Allomancy, Feruchemy, and ­Hemalurgy that ­influences his or her emotions. Confidence is boosted, and should the character have turned his or her back on deeply held beliefs for any reason, drawing on stored identity helps ground and reaffirm them those beliefs. It also helps the ­character recover from serious mental hardships, including Burdens inflicted ­during a Mental Conflict.
Everyone’s identity is shaped over time by their experiences, and stored ­identity is no different. Like any Feruchemical transfer, identity is set at the time it’s stored, and tapping it later — especially in large amounts — can “reset” the character’s personality to that earlier version of him or herself. In this way, an altruistic freedom fighter with large amounts of their identity stored prior to ­becoming a Steel Inquisitor or the willing pawn of a vile crime lord might tap his or her aluminummind to regain lost convictions and once again walk an ­honorable path. Such a radical process is quite traumatic, of course, and can ­eventually ­impact the Feruchemist’s psyche in unpredictable ways.
### Storing
While storing identity, you lose 1 die per charge currently being stored with rolls made to resist manipulation of any sort, including deception, seduction, intimidation, and interrogation. Additionally, the Result of Zinc and Brass rolls to influence your emotions improves by 1 per charge currently being stored (which may mean a failed Zinc or Brass roll ­becomes a ­success, if this brings the Result high enough). The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Aluminum rating or your Spirit score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with rolls made to resist manipulation of any sort, including deception, seduction, ­intimidation, and interrogation. Additionally, the Outcome of Zinc and Brass rolls to influence your emotions worsens by 1 per charge tapped (which may turn a successful Zinc or Brass roll into a failure).
### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of identity returns to an earlier point in his or her life, shaking off opinions, preferences, personality shifts, and even trauma from the intervening time. This removes all traces of emotional ­Allomancy, hypnotic suggestions, brainwashing, long-term stress, and Mental Burdens ­accumulated in that period, and also resets your mindset, penchants, loyalties, and other things that make you a unique persona. The more Aluminum that’s tapped, the further back you may regress:

| Charges Tapped | Time Regressed                                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | Restores your identity as it was up to an hour ago<br>                        |
| 20             | Restores your identity as it was up to a day ago<br>                          |
| 30             | Restores your identity as it was up to a week ago<br>                         |
| 40             | Restores your identity as it was up to a month ago<br>                        |
| 50             | Restores your identity as it was up to a year ago<br>                         |
| 75             | Restores your identity as it was up to a decade ago<br>                       |
| 100            | Wipes your identity clean — your personality is essentially a blank slate<br> |
Tapping 10 or more charges of Aluminum immediately sets your Willpower to exactly 1 — unless it’s currently 0, in which case it remains at 0. This represents your struggle with the sudden and potentially mind-shattering change in your personality.
Resetting or even wiping your identity doesn’t change your memory (that’s what Copper does). Some Feruchemists store memories in a coppermind before tapping large amounts of identity, essentially gaining a whole new perspective on those memories.
### Roleplaying with Aluminum
Feruchemical Aluminum is perhaps the most metaphysical and roleplay-driven Power in the Mistborn Adventure Game. When using it, ask yourself what makes your Hero tick — what are his or her most deeply held beliefs, relationships, and character traits, and what would change if any of these were weaker or stronger? How can this be represented in the story by degrees? The key is understanding the central tenants of your Hero’s personality, and presenting fragments of those in various strengths — that’s what makes Aluminum interesting and fun for everyone involved.
When storing identity your Hero should seem kind of wishy-washy: distracted, unconvincing, and impressionable. Think of anyone who’s had a hard time making up their mind, or someone who struggles to make decisions, and emulate them. A typically patriotic Hero might not support his or her cause as much, and a frequently aggressive Hero might become passive and docile, less inclined to seize the initiative.
Conversely, tapping identity plants your Hero firmly in his or her ways. A patriot might become a stubborn champion of his or her cause, while an aggressive character would never pass up opportunities or get out into the thick of it.
Both extremes are dangerous and can exhibit like compulsions, forcing a character to act in ways that might threaten his or her safety, or jeopardize the Crew’s efforts.
## Hemalurgy
Depending on where an Aluminum spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Allomantic Power derived from any one of the four Enhancement Metals (e.g. the ability to empty or hyper-flare the metals of oneself or another). Each spike may store only one Power and so most Hemalurgists steal the ability to burn Duralumin due to its incredible power. Fortunately, with Aluminum prohibitively expensive and Duralumin Mistings exceedingly hard to detect, these spikes remain very rare even in the Inquisition.
### Spike
Costs 2 x Allomancy rating [[Advancements]]
An Aluminum spike grants you a single Allomantic Power — Aluminum, Duralumin, Chromium, or Nicrosil — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit by 1, as normal.
# Duralumin
Duralumin is a rare alloy of aluminum and copper, and is either unknown or at most known only to very few metallurgists during the Lord Ruler’s reign. It becomes more widely understood during the reign of King Elend.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Duralumin is called a Duralumin Gnat. Due to the peculiar potential of this metal, this hapless Allomancer gains no benefit from his or her “ability.”
Burning Duralumin briefly and radically increases the power of any other metals the Allomancer is burning. The effect is nothing short of astonishing — ­Duralumin
and Steel, for example, might let a character Push an ­armored carriage across a wide river, while Duralumin and Brass might leave a target unable to feel anything for hours. The effect is so strong it consumes not only all Duralumin in a character’s system but all other metals as well. ­Fortunately, metals stored but not currently burning are unaffected.
Duralumin’s downside is that the extreme burst of power is like a tidal wave — impossible to control, only direct — and so subtlety and nuance are abandoned in a single, brutal flash of extreme Allomantic force. Many Mistborn are caught off-guard by this, not to mention the sudden loss of all burning metals a moment later, and react in impulsive, even volatile ways.
### Rules
Burning Duralumin produces a sudden and overwhelming burst of Allomantic power from every metal you’re currently burning. When you have Duralumin stored and take an Allomantic action, you may elect to simultaneously burn ­Duralumin as a reaction. This choice must be made before you roll the dice. If you do burn Duralumin, you may apply one of two effects to your Allomantic action
- Your Result increases by 1/2 your Duralumin rating, rounded up (which may mean a failed roll becomes a success, if this brings the Result high enough).
- You gain a number of Nudges with the roll equal to your Dualumin rating.
Don’t forget — every other metal you’re currently is affected as well, though not exactly in the same way. As all rolls have already been made for those ­metals, their Outcomes improve by 1/2 your Duralumin rating, rounded up — but again, only for this Beat. All charges of all metals you’re currently burning are ­extinguished at the end of this Beat, regardless.
You can also burn Duralumin as an independent action, improving the ­Outcomes of every metal you’re currently burning by 1/2 your Duralumin rating, rounded up. At the end of the Beat, though, all charges for those metals are gone.
Duralumin can have powerful narrative benefits that add much more to the game than the dice roll. For example, burning the metal with Atium might let you see the ultimate outcome of an action, while burning it with Gold could show a skein of possibilities stretching out to the very horizons of time. In cases where Duralumin’s impact isn’t immediately evident, work with the Narrator to ­determine what exactly happens; whatever the effect, it should fall well beyond the limits of “normal” Allomancy.
Narrators should remember that Duralumin’s power is barely controllable, and that its effects are nearly always obvious, even to untrained observers — a Steelpush enhanced by Duralumin may literally shred a metal door, a Pewter boost might turn the character into a hulking monster, and so forth. Beyond the immediate impact on the story, such wanton indulgences of Allomancy are a great way to get spotted by the Steel Ministry...
### Controlling Hemalurgic Creations
Burning Duralumin in combination with Brass lets you ignore the rating requirement when attempting to control koloss and kandra (see page 226).
### Burn Rate
Burning Duralumin instantly consumes all charges of this and every other burning metal in your system.
### Flaring & Savants
Because the metal burns instantly, Duralumin may not be flared, and no Savants have ever been discovered.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Duralumin to store their emotional and spiritual connection to others. While storing, the character ­becomes emotionally distant, alienated from his loved ones and trusted associates. Likewise, he’s found less interesting and ­attractive by others, and most passersby would be hard-pressed to remember him at all.
Tapping connection, on the other hand, makes the ­character more empathetic and connected to those around him, and ­increases the trust and authority others place in him. In this way a Feruchemist can use connection to affect casual and profound relationships alike, “spiking” negotiations and closing deals at important political or social events while also reinforcing personal friendships and alliances.
### Storing
While storing connection, you lose 1 ­Reputation per charge currently being stored, and also lose 1 die per charge currently being stored with Charm and Influence rolls relying on your relationships with others. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Duralumin rating or your Reputation minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 Reputation and add 1 die with Charm and Influence rolls relying on your relationships with others.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of connection becomes inhumanly charismatic and influential, and may also overcome Social Burdens he or she has suffered (even otherwise permanent ones like exile and manhunts). Some speculate that the great fealty afforded the Lord Ruler was partially a result of immense stored connection, selectively tapped to ensure absolute loyalty of close allies and advisors. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Duralumin include:

| Charges Tapped | Social Burdens Overcome and Other Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | You lose one Serious Social Burden and turn heads wherever you go, inserting yourself into any social situation with relative ease. People are inclined to notice you at first sight and often strive to emulate you. Likewise, you take a keen interest in everyone around you and are prone to emulate them                                                                                                    |
| 30             | You lose all Serious Social Burdens and anyone you spend a few minutes speaking to in a friendly manner feels a strong connection to you, as if they’ve known you for years. Old acquaintances suddenly feel as if you’re their closest friend. Likewise, you have difficulty betraying anyone other than a sworn enemy — or anyone you’re speaking with at the moment.                                          |
| 50             | You lose one Grave Social Burden and regularly inspire feelings of love at first sight, often feeling much the same in return. You can easily befriend anyone who isn’t a sworn enemy and feel sincere friendship with anyone you let in.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 70             | You lose all Grave Social Burdens and inspire feelings akin to worship in anyone who converses with you. No one can attack you until and unless you pose an immediate and obvious physical threat to them, or someone they’re protecting. You’re in the same position, unable to harm those who don’t prove themselves a clear and immediate danger to you and yours. You feel a profound love for all humanity. |
| 90             | You lose one Mortal Social Burden and are the object of absolute devotion by all but sworn enemies. Most will lay down their lives at your word, and happily submit to your every wish — as will you for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
## Hemalurgy
Depending on where a Duralumin spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and ­transfers a single Feruchemical Power derived from any one of the four ­Enhancement Metals (e.g. the ability to store or tap identity, connection, fortune, or investiture). Each spike may store only one Power.
Because the abilities stored in Duralumin are so personal, these spikes can be very dangerous. A character receiving one may wind up permanently sharing his head with the spike’s previous victim, or worse, find their own personality completely overridden.
### Spike
Costs 2 x Feruchemy rating [[Advancements]]
A Duralumin spike grants you a single Feruchemical power — Aluminum, Duralumin, Chromium, or Nicrosil — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit by 1, as normal.
# Chromium
Chromium is a very scarce metal, and essentially unknown during the Lord Ruler’s era. Knowledge of its existence is limited to records dating back to the dawn of the Empire, now hidden deep in the archives of the Steel Ministry.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Chromium is called a Leecher. Chromium functions exactly like Aluminum, except that when burnt it drains the Allomantic stores of anyone the Leecher touches, rather than those of the Allomancer. With a supply of Chromium, a character can quickly stymie an Allomancer with a single touch. The only defenses are to avoid the character’s touch, or burn Chromium and touch the character first.
Fortunately for the embattled Allomancers of the Final Empire, Chromium remains a “lost metal” during the Lord Ruler’s reign. Of course, an intrepid or skillful crew might turn up information about it, and such a discovery would be an invaluable prize — and certainly a Major Secret — for any number of noble houses, hazekillers, or agents of the Steel Ministry. Indeed, it could be the greatest weapon any of them could ever hope for.
### Rules
When you make skin-to-skin contact with one Allomancer — by holding their hand, making a barehanded attack, grappling, or through other means — you may burn a single charge of Chromium, instantly burning all charges of all Allomantic metals in their system and leaving them powerless until more metal is consumed. This does not tell you what metals are in their system, nor does it have any impact on metals they carry.
### Burn Rate & Flaring
Like other Enhancement Metals, Chromium burns instantly and can’t be flared.
### Stunts
#### Defensive Leeching
You may burn Chromium as a reaction to an incoming attack. When an Allomancer hits or otherwise makes skin-to-skin contact with you, you may immediately burn Chromium, depleting the attacker’s charges the moment the attack is resolved. Should the attacker also be burning Chromium, both your charges are simultaneously consumed as the attack is resolved. You can take this Stunt a second time, gaining the ability to reactively burn Chromium with such speed that you can burn through an opponent’s stored metal charges before his or her attack is resolved. If the opponent has also taken this Stunt twice, both your metal stores are consumed as usual.
#### Multiple Targets
You may consume the metal stores of any number of ­characters you’re touching, at a cost of 1 Chromium charge per target.
### Savants
Due to Chromium’s rarity and high burn rate, no Savants have been ­discovered.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Chromium to store luck, during which they’re plagued with bad fortune of all sorts — the odds turn against them and anything that can go wrong, does. Worse still, it marginalizes a character, excluding him or her from the schemes of the universe and the fickle whim of the powers that be.
Conversely, Feruchemists tapping fortune become flush with good luck. Opportunities fall into their laps, chance ­encounters yield amazing benefits, and dumb luck makes up for any lack of skill. Tapping heaps of fortune elevates a character to something akin to an epic hero, able not only to trust in a bigger plan to take care of their needs, but to rely on the favor of gods as a palpable source of support.
### Storing
While storing luck, you lose 1 die per charge currently being stored with all Spirit rolls. Additionally, you suffer minor ­mishaps, stumbling over loose ground, accidentally breaking inconsequential gear, and the like. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Chromium rating or your Spirit score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with all Spirit rolls. Additionally, you benefit from small lucky breaks, just missing deep mud puddles, winning most hands of Shelldry with ease, and so forth.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist tapping huge amounts of luck can blithely achieve the impossible despite nearly any odds. For every 10 charges you tap, you may re-roll one die after finding your Result but before the Outcome is described. You may tap to re-roll any number of dice in a single pool but must declare the number and consume the charges all at once, resulting in only one additional roll. The second Result stands, even if it’s worse than the first.
## Hemalurgy
Chromium has no known Hemalurgic applications.
# Nicrosil
Nicrosil is a rare and complex alloy incorporating chromium, which is for all intents and purposes unknown to the people of the Final Empire. When the metal is available, however, Allomancers and Feruchemists use it to greatly enhance their connection to the source of all metaphysical power.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Nicrosil is called a Nicroburst or a Nicro.
By burning Nicrosil and touching another Allomancer, a character can flare the other person’s metals in a single, massive burst of power, as if that person were burning ­Duralumin. The force generated by this burst is ­overwhelmingly powerful, consuming all the Allomancer’s stored metals in a heartbeat, and tearing down the barriers of his or her ability. A Nicro-boosted Thug might be able to tear a wagon in half with his bare hands, while a Nicro-boosted Rioter could whip a crowd into a relentless, mindless frenzy.
Many Allomancers have no access to Enhancement Metals on their own, and Nicrosil represents the only way these characters can boost their abilities beyond their own natural limits. Clever Nicrosil-burners can use this to their ­advantage, carefully timing creative applications of the metal to surprise opponents with a flood of unexpected Allomantic power. This might send a Steelpushing ­Coinshot flying into the air or hyper-stimulate a Tineye’s senses to the point of agony,l­eaving either with no metal reserves in the process. This combination of offensive and support applications makes Nicrosil-burners a treasured asset in any crew.
### Rules
When you make skin-to-skin contact with one Allomancer who’s ­burning one or more metals — by holding their hand, making a barehanded attack, ­grappling, or through other means — you may burn Nicrosil, producing a sudden and ­overwhelming burst of Allomantic power within them. Your target’s next action must be to use one of the metals burning in his or her system, and if that action requires a roll you may apply one of two effects
- You target’s Result increases by 1/2 your Nicrosil rating, rounded up (which may mean a failed roll becomes a success, if this brings the Result high enough).
- Your target gains a number of Nudges with the roll equal to your Nicrosil rating.
This consumes all charges of Nicrosil in your system, and all charges of all metals in your target’s system, leaving them powerless until more metal is ­consumed. This does not tell you what metals are in their system, nor does it have any impact on metals they carry.
As with Duralumin, the wave of power triggered by Nicrosil lets the ­target achieve spectacular effects and the metal also provides powerful narrative ­benefits, both at the expense of discretion and control. This is part of what makes Nicrosil such a great offensive metal — by touching an unsuspecting Allomancer, you can not only force him or her to reveal a Power, but you can partially control how strongly that Power manifests as well. The fact that Nicrosil consumes your target’s Allomantic charges in the process makes it nearly as useful as Chromium (though significantly riskier to use).
### Controlling Hemalurgic Creations
Burning Nicrosil in ­combination with another character’s Brass lets them ignore the rating ­requirement when attempting to control koloss and kandra (see page 226).
### Burn Rate
Nicrosil burns instantly, consuming all charges in your system, along with all charges of all metals in your target’s system.
### Flaring & Savants
Because the metal burns instantly, Nicrosil may not be flared, and no Savants have ever been discovered.
### Stunts
#### Limited Nicroburst
When you burn Nicrosil, you learn the metals your t­arget is currently burning, though not the number of charges the target has stored for each metal. You may choose to ignore one metal your target is currently ­burning, leaving any charges of that metal unaffected by the burst. You may not ignore the only metal your target has stored, as that would mean no charges are consumed and no power is generated to fuel the burst.
#### Multiple Targets
You may consume the metal stores of any number of ­characters you’re touching, rather than just one.
#### Selective Nicroburst
When you burn Nicrosil, you may choose the metal your target must use for his or her next action (though not how it’s used, if there are multiple options).
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Nicrosil to store “investiture,” or their connection to the source of metaphysical power (in Feruchemy, this means the deepest recesses of the self). Even the most learned Feruchemical scholars don’t fully understand the nature of this ability, but some believe stored investiture is the rawest form of personal potential — the primal root of a Feruchemist’s ability.
In practical terms, this exceedingly rare metal grants a ­character the very potent ability to transform a stored characteristic — such as weight, strength, sight, or the like — into a “generic” source of power called “­investiture.” The Feruchemist may then tap investiture to augment nearly any other tapped ability, from physical strength to mental speed and beyond. In this way investiture is the most potent enhancement available in Feruchemy, a reserve of pure, universal power that can amplify nearly any Feruchemical effort.
The promise of Nicrosil becomes even more astounding if you consider it in relation to one of the incredibly powerful sources of power in the Final Empire (such as the Well of Ascension or the mists). Theoretically, a character exposed to one of these might be able to transform and store its seemingly limitless power, putting near-godlike power at his or her disposal. Fortunately, no Feruchemist in known history has been in this situation, but if ever there was something for the Lord Ruler to strive for...
### Storing
When storing investiture, you’re essentially transforming the charges stored in any single metalmind into an indistinct,­ ­universal power that’s kept within your nicrosilmind. The maximum number of charges you may transform in any hour is equal to your Nicrosil rating, and this number is halved, rounding down, in the process.
This process is all-consuming and disrupts communication with other metalminds, which has a couple effects. First, you may not tap any metalminds while storing charges in a nicrosilmind, and second, you may only ever transform charges and store from a single metalmind at any time.
Should you somehow receive a boost of power from an external source, like the Well of Ascension, the mists, or Duralumin or Nicrosil Allomancy, you can transform and store it in a nicrosilmind instead of using it immediately. In this case any gained dice and bonuses to Result and/or Outcome are totaled and halved, rounding down, to determine how much investiture is stored. Your hourly limit still applies, however, so it’s unlikely that you would be able to take full advantage of the awesome force at hand. You could, of course, linger for hours if the power persists and there aren’t other compelling reasons to leave (unlikely in such important places), but you’re still limited to the storage capacity of your nicrosilmind(s).
### Tapping
Tapping a nicrosilmind is only useful in concert with at least one other metalmind. Charges of investiture may be used as any other Feruchemical charges, and charges from one or more nicrosilminds may be tapped and added to any number of Feruchemical efforts at the same time. You may not, however, add more charges of investiture to any effort than you’re ­tapping from a metalmind of the appropriate type.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist tapping huge amounts of investiture can actually funnel his ability into a metalmind belonging to another Feruchemist, essentially ­overwriting the abilities originally stored therein with raw investiture. For every 10 charges of investiture you tap, you may reduce the number of charges in any metalmind you’re touching by 5. These charges are forever lost.
Take care! This destructive ability is rarely met with pleasure, and may result in a Physique vs. Physique action if the metalmind’s owner is awake and nearby.
## Hemalurgy
Nicrosil has no known Hemalurgic applications.
# Gold
Gold is rare and precious, one of only two Temporal Metals known to the people of the Final Empire.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Gold is called an Auger. Though Gold is prized as a component for jewelry and coinage, it’s rarely used by Allomancers due to its unusual and disconcerting power — the ability to see one’s possible pasts. When burning Gold, a character experiences the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of a different and earlier self, as would have been if he or she had made different choices.
Though the character’s feelings and thoughts while burning Gold are real, the images seen are illusions, possibilities swimming through the mind as divergent paths are explored. Nothing can change the past, of course — ­everything witnessed is merely a hollow phantom of reality — and this sad truth, coupled with the chance of finding a past that’s decidedly better than one’s own, is enough to keep those capable of burning the metal from doing so with any ­frequency.
### Rules
While burning Gold, your perception splits. You remain aware of your true, present self and your life as it is now, but you also gain the memories and ­knowledge of pasts you might have lived. This is, in effect, a chance to do things differently, though only in a very convincing fantasy.
When looking into the past, time elapses as in reality — you experience one minute of an alternate past for every minute you burn Gold in the present. There’s no limit to how far back you can diverge from your established history, and ­alternate pasts appear to you with crystal clarity.
The Narrator may require a Gold roll if you wish to witness a very specific parallel (“What if I’d made this decision?” rather than “What’s another way this could have gone?”). The more specific the divergence and the further back in time it occurs, the higher the roll’s Difficulty.
This Power has several interesting applications, such as learning from a past mistake, reflecting upon your mindset at a particular point in time, or even ­recalling a detail you’ve forgotten. As with exploring the consequences of specific divergences, a Gold roll may be required for any of these efforts, with a Difficulty based on the same factors.
Burning Gold is mentally and emotionally taxing as your conscious mind struggles with a torrent of new information and grapples with the fact that none of it is real. Consequently, you lose 1 Willpower each time you start burning Gold.
Being a Gold Misting is... well, in most people’s eyes, it’s about as useful as an Aluminum Gnat. It does have its uses, but the practical application has more to do with roleplaying and characterization than hard and fast game rules.
### Burn Rate
Gold burns at a rate of 10 minutes per charge, or 1 minute per charge when flared.
### Flaring
Flaring Gold provides no additional benefits beyond ­increasing your Gold rating.
### Stunts
#### Golden Will
You’re perfectly comfortable recalling multiple lives, and so you don’t lose Willpower when burning Gold.
#### Hindsight
The power of hindsight informs your present decisions, often very well. While burning Gold, you gain 1 die with Wits rolls.
### Savants
An Auger Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Gold rolls, but also has a drastically altered view of the world, struggling to discern the present from the past. When not burning Gold, the Savant’s Willpower drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Gold to store health, during which they become sickly, frail, and vulnerable to disease. Tapping health does much the opposite, boosting endurance, ­heightening ­immunities, and speeding recovery rate. Tapping massive amounts of stored health can make a Feruchemist nearly ­invincible, able to regenerate from even the most severe injuries with inhuman speed. The most notorious Gold Feruchemists are Steel Inquisitors, which is why so many believe they can’t be slain my mortal men.
### Storing
While storing charges in a goldmind, you lose 1 Health per charge currently being stored. Also, you do not naturally recover Health when storing these charges (see page 187). The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Gold rating or your Health score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
Gold a rare exception to the general tapping rules, in that its effects are felt for a period longer than a single action. For each charge you tap, your Health temporarily increases by 1. This lasts for one hour, after which the extra Health is lost again. Should this drop your Health to 0 you fall unconscious, and if it drops your Health below 0 you collapse and will die unless someone can stabilize you with a Wits 3 roll (see page 183).
Additionally, you naturally recover Health at a faster rate when tapping these charges: 1 in any hour when you tap up to 5 charges, and 1 per minute in any hour when you tap more.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of health instantly recovers from physical injury, and may also overcome Physical Burdens he or she has suffered (even otherwise permanent ones like scars and missing limbs). ­Decapitation and other forms of instant death are still fatal for you, no matter how many charges you have stored, but you can quickly or in some cases instantly recover from lesser injuries. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Gold include:
BOOK TWO

| Charges Tapped | Physical Burdens Overcome and Other Examples                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | You lose one Serious Physical Burden; instantly recover 1 Health; or immediately overcome a common illness, like a cold or food poisoning.                              |
| 30             | You lose all Serious Physical Burdens; instantly recover 2 Health; immediately overcome a debilitating illness like the flu; or flush a simple poison from your system. |
| 50             | You lose one Grave Physical Burden; instantly recover 3 Health; immediately overcome a serious illness like the measles; or flush an average poison from your system.   |
| 70             | You lose all Grave Physical Burdens; instantly recover 4 Health; immediately overcome a deadly illness like the plague; or flush a powerful poison from your system.    |
| 90             | You lose one Mortal Physical Burden; instantly recover 5 Health; immediately overcome organ failure or cancer; or flush a lethal poison from your system.               |
## Hemalurgy
Depending on where a Gold spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Feruchemical Power derived from any one of the four Temporal Metals (e.g. the ability to store and tap health, determination, breath, or energy). Each spike may store only one Power.
### Spike
Costs 2 x Feruchemy rating [[Advancements]]
A Gold spike grants you a single Feruchemical Power — Gold, Electrum, Cadmium, or Bendalloy — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit by 1, as normal.
# Electrum
Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver. While it’s known to metallurgists of the Final Empire, the Lord Ruler has suppressed knowledge of its Allomantic properties to prevent a decline in the value of atium. Consequently, Electrum is most commonly found in the hands of Steel Ministry agents, Inquisitors, powerful nobles, and Allomancers and Feruchemists with a keen interest in history.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Electrum is called an Oracle.
Burning Electrum lets an Allomancer glimpse a few moments in his own future, seeing actions he might take along with their consequences. With practice an Oracle can hone this ability to spot impending danger, such as ­walking into a trap or being struck by an incoming blow. This “­danger sense” is limited to the character’s own actions and does not identify the source of danger or knowledge of ­anything else beyond the immediate peril.
Electrum also has another, much more powerful application — countering the effects of Atium. An Allomancer burning Atium can see a few moments into an opponent’s future, but a character burning Electrum can see the same shadows and adjust accordingly, effectively negating the advantage.
Knowledge of this latter property is considered potentially disastrous for the Final Empire’s economy, both by the Steel Ministry and high-ranking nobles in the know, as Atium’s value as a commodity is tied both to its rarity and its ­incredible Allomantic power. If a much more readily available metal like ­Electrum were to compromise that power or value, it would strike a dire blow to the financial standings of everyone in the Empire. Thus, the Steel Inquisition and most powerful Houses conspire to suppress knowledge of Electrum’s Allomantic properties, ensuring that by the final years of the Lord Ruler’s reign nearly no one outside the highest levels of imperial society is aware of the metal’s true potential.
### Rules
While burning Electrum, you see a shadowy vision of yourself one Beat in the future, much as a character burning Atium sees shadow images of others. You cannot see your surroundings, only yourself and the actions you might take. For example, you might see yourself collapsing in a hail of arrows, but you wouldn’t see the actions of those firing them, or where the archers are located.
The Narrator may require an Electrum roll if you wish to see the ­consequences of a specific action (“What might happen if I go left?” rather than “What does the future hold for me?”). The more specific the request, the higher the roll’s ­Difficulty.
When burning Electrum in a Conflict, you gain a number of Defense Dice in each round equal to your Electrum rating. These dice are added the first time you gain Defense Dice in each round (generally after you take an action, when you choose to actively defend, or when you defend against an attack).
Finally, when you’re burning Electrum and a character burning Atium takes an action targeting or opposing you (such as an attack targeting you, or a ­Contest against you), the number of dice he or she gains from Atium drops by your ­Electrum rating (to a minimum of 0 dice).
### Burn
Electrum burns at a rate of 10 minutes per charge, or 1 minute per charge while flared.
### Flaring
Flaring Electrum provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Electrum rating.
### Stunts
#### Instinctive Burning
You instinctively start burning Electrum in response to threats, gaining Defense Dice from Electrum whenever you’re attacked — even when you aren’t aware of the impending attack (e.g. when you’re ambushed or ­attacked in your sleep). This grants no extra benefit if you’re attacked while ­already burning Electrum.
### Savants
An Oracle Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Electrum rolls, but also feels naked and exposed ­whenever the next moment isn’t evident. When not burning Electrum, the Savant’s Willpower drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Electrum to store determination, and while doing so they display little motivation or initiative, as if deeply depressed. While tapping, on the other hand, they’re exceedingly confident, eager to take risks and facing danger head on, without fear. Tapping great determination results in something akin to a manic high, letting them act despite any and all setbacks, trauma, and mental anguish. It also lets them shake off what for lesser ­beings would be soul-crushing pain.
### Storing
While storing determination, your Willpower drops by 1 per charge currently being stored. Also, you do not naturally recover Willpower when storing these charges (see page 187). The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Electrum rating or your ­Willpower score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
Electrum is a rare exception to the general ­tapping rules, in that its effects are felt for a period longer than a single action. For each charge you tap, your Willpower temporarily increases by 1. This lasts for one hour, after which the extra Willpower is lost again. Should this drop your Willpower to 0 you break down or mentally crack, and if it drops your Willpower below 0 you collapse into a fugue and will be forever lost in it unless someone can stabilize you with a Charm 3 roll (see page 183).
Additionally, you naturally recover Willpower at a faster rate when tapping these charges: 1 in any hour when you tap up to 5 charges, and 1 per minute in any hour when you tap more.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of determination becomes nearly i­nvincible in his or her own mind — able to brush off ongoing trauma and ­instantly recover from significant mental strain. Feats you may achieve by tapping 10 or more charges of Electrum include:

| Charges Tapped | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | Instantly recover 1 Willpower; brace yourself for minor mental strain, reducing the damage of each successful attack against your Willpower by 1 for the next hour; or shake off a minor traumatic event, such as seeing a dead body<br>                |
| 30             | Instantly recover 2 Willpower; brace yourself for moderate mental strain, reducing the damage of each successful attack against your Willpower by 2 for the next hour; or shake off a moderate traumatic event, such as witnessing torture<br>          |
| 50             | Instantly recover 3 Willpower; brace yourself for acute mental strain, reducing the damage of each successful attack against your Willpower by 3 for the next hour; or shake off an acute traumatic event, such as witnessing a murder<br>              |
| 70             | Instantly recover 4 Willpower; brace yourself for dire mental strain, reducing the damage of each successful attack against your Willpower by 4 for the next hour; or shake off a dire traumatic event, such as committing a murder.<br>                |
| 90             | Instantly recover 5 Willpower; brace yourself for crushing mental strain, reducing the damage of each successful attack against your Willpower by 5 for the next hour; or shake off a crushing traumatic event, such as seeing a loved one murdered<br> |
## Hemalurgy
Electrum has no known Hemalurgic applications.
# Cadmium
Cadmium is a relatively rare and expensive element that’s almost exclusively used by Allomancers and Feruchemists. It’s unknown during the Lord Ruler’s reign but an intrepid investigator could potentially find accounts of the metal dating back to before the Ascension.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Cadmium is called a Pulser.
Burning Cadmium lets an Allomancer slow time in the immediate vicinity. The character perceives this area as a faintly shimmering “bubble,” outside which everything races past at breakneck speed. He or she can move around inside but leaving the bubble destroys it, snapping everything back to real time.
Those outside the bubble have trouble seeing it, and view the Allomancer and everything else inside as frozen in place. Anyone other than the ­Allomancer who enters the area slows down, and any of them who leave speed up. This experience is jarring for most people, like being caught in the current of a fast-moving river.
The bubble also renders most physical attacks futile, as objects entering and leaving — whether held or thrown — are cast askew.
Cadmium-burners aren’t viewed as especially powerful Allomancers, but they can be quite useful for “skipping” long periods of time and keeping the injured alive with limited supplies. Also, because a bubble is easily missed, a cagey Allomancer can disorient or delay pursuers, or simply outwait them.
### Rules
While burning Cadmium, you may create a “time-bubble” centered on yourself, within which time slows down — for each minute inside, a number of minutes may pass outside up to 20 × your Cadmium rating (i.e. with a Cadmium rating of 4, one minute inside the bubble may equal up to 80 minutes outside). You must set the time differential when the bubble is created, and it remains the same until the bubble is dismissed or destroyed. You must also choose the bubble’s area, which can extend outward up to 100 paces (Medium Range).
Characters and objects crossing into or out of the time-bubble are jolted by the experience...
- Any living being entering or exiting is momentarily disoriented, losing a Beat (see page 136).
- A physical attack made through the bubble, whether held or thrown, is nearly impossible to land. The defender — whether it’s you or someone else — gains a number of “free” dice equal to your Cadmium rating with each roll made to defend.
Should your bubble overlap another Cadmium bubble, the time differential of the overlapping area is equal to the sum of both. Thus, if a bubble set to one minute inside for every 10 minutes outside overlapped with a bubble set to one minute inside for every 30 minutes outside, one minute would pass in the overlapping area for every 40 minutes in the outside world.
If your bubble overlaps a Bendalloy bubble, time is either slower in the ­overlapping area (if your time differential is higher than that of the Bendalloy bubble), or faster (if the Bendalloy bubble’s time differential is higher). The actual differential is equal to the higher minus the lower.
### Burn Rate
Cadmium burns at a rate of 30 minutes per charge (that pass for you), or 3 minutes per charge while flared.
### Flaring
Flaring Cadmium provides no additional benefits ­beyond increasing your Cadmium rating.
### Stunts
#### Long-Range Bubble
Your Cadmium bubbles may extend outward up to 300 paces (Long Range).
#### Slower Time
The time differential within your bubbles may be set to up to 40 × your Cadmium rating (i.e. with a Cadmium rating of 4, one minute inside the bubble may equal up to 160 minutes outside).
### Savants
A Pulser Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Cadmium rolls, but is also exposed to the raw fabric of time, which can lead to supreme arrogance... or ­primal terror. When not burning Cadmium, the Savant’s Influence score drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Cadmium to store breath, which leaves them winded and prone to hyperventilation. Tapping breath lets them go many minutes, or even hours without breathing, and drawing on large amounts of it floods their systems with oxygen, extending their endurance to near-superhuman levels.
### Storing
While storing breath, you lose 1 die per charge currently being stored with Physique rolls related to endurance. Also, you may not hold your breath for any meaningful length of time. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Cadmium rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, you gain 1 die with Physique rolls related to endurance and a full minute of oxygen, which can be used an emergency supply in a hostile environment.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of breath can “supercharge” his or her blood, going without air for prolonged periods of time. For every 10 charges of breath you tap, you may go without breathing for a full hour.
## Hemalurgy
Cadmium has no known Hemalurgic applications.
# Bendalloy
This cadmium alloy becomes liquid if placed in a hot drink or raised to similar temperatures. While not as expensive as aluminum, bendalloy is almost as expensive as gold and thus somewhat rare. Like Cadmium, Bendalloy is unknown during the Lord Ruler’s reign.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can burn Bendalloy is called a Slider.
Burning Bendalloy lets an Allomancer speed time in the immediate vicinity. The character perceives this area as a faintly shimmering “bubble,” outside which everything grinds past at a snail’s pace. He or she can move around inside but leaving the bubble destroys it, snapping everything back to real time.
Those outside the bubble have trouble seeing it, and view the ­Allomancer and everything else inside the area as non-stop blurs of motion. ­Anyone other than the Allomancer who enters the area speeds up, and any of them who leave slow down. This experience is jarring for most people, like being caught in the current of a fast-moving river.
The bubble also renders most physical attacks futile, as objects entering and leaving — whether held or thrown — are cast askew.
Bendalloy is generally considered more useful than Cadmium in a number of ways. Those in a Bendalloy bubble act and react with much greater speed than those outside, seizing the initiative with aplomb and dodging attacks with ease. They can filch items in a split-second, complete a disguise before anyone knows they’re making the attempt, and perform complex tasks like cracking safes and conducting research in a fraction of the “usual” time. For all these reasons and more, Bendalloy is a favorite tool of assassins, thieves, and anyone else who relies on the element of surprise.
### Rules
While burning Bendalloy, you may create a “time-bubble” centered on yourself, within which time speeds up — for each minute outside, a number of minutes may pass inside up to 10 × your Bendalloy rating (i.e. with a Bendalloy rating of 4, up to 40 minutes may pass inside for each minute outside). You must set the time differential when the bubble is created, and it remains the same until the ­bubble is dismissed or destroyed. You must also choose the bubble’s area, which can extend outward up to 10 paces (Close Range).
Characters and objects crossing into or out of the time-bubble are jolted by
the experience...
- Any living being entering or exiting is momentarily disoriented, losing a Beat (see page 136).
- A physical attack made through the bubble, whether held or thrown, is robbed of its kinetic energy, often with an audible “pop.” This makes these attacks nearly impossible to land, and grants the defender — whether it’s you or someone else — a number of “free dice” equal to your Bendalloy rating with each roll made to defend.
Additionally, characters inside the bubble gain the following benefits.
- Your Bendalloy rating is added to each character’s Wits score for the purpose of declaring actions in a Conflict (see page 172). This does not impact the character’s Wits score under any other circumstances.
- Each time a character in the bubble takes an action against a character outside it, he or she gains a number of dice with that action equal to your Bendalloy rating.
Should your bubble overlap another Bendalloy bubble, the time differential of the overlapping area is equal to the sum of both. Thus, if a bubble set to one minute outside for every 20 minutes inside overlapped with a bubble set to one minute outside for every 5 minutes inside, 25 minutes would pass in the overlapping area for every one minute in the outside world.
If your bubble overlaps a Cadmium bubble, time is either faster in the overlapping area (if your time differential is higher than that of the Cadmium bubble), or slower (if the Cadmium bubble’s time differential is higher). The actual differential is equal to the higher minus the lower.
### Burn Rate
Bendalloy burns at a rate of 5 minutes per charge (that pass for you), or 30 seconds per charge while flared.
### Flaring
Flaring Bendalloy provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Bendalloy rating.
### Stunts
#### Faster Time
The time differential within your bubbles may be set to up to 20 × your Bendalloy rating (i.e. with a Bendalloy rating of 3, one minute outside the bubble may equal up to 60 minutes inside).
#### Medium-Range Bubble
Your Bendalloy bubbles may extend outward up to 100 paces (Medium Range).
### Savants
A Slider Savant gains two “free” Nudges with Bendalloy rolls, but also views him or herself as a true master of time and grows peevish with anything short of absolute control. When not burning Bendalloy, the Savant’s Charm score drops by 1.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Bendalloy to store energy — ­specifically, the caloric energy provided by food and drink. While ­storing ­energy, they burn calories at an alarming rate, becoming ­insatiably hungry and possessing an unquenchable thirst. Conversely, ­tapping energy lets them forgo food and drink for extended periods of time, and tapping large amounts of energy can increase their body fat. Clever Feruchemists use ­bendalloyminds not only to survive lean times, but to change their appearances or conceal their identities.
### Storing
While storing energy, you lose 1 die with ­Physique rolls for every two charges currently being stored. You may store either food or drink energy in each bendalloymind, but not both. The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Bendalloy rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge of food energy you tap you may ignore the effects of hunger for one day. Likewise, for each charge of drink energy you tap, you may ignore the effects of thirst for one day.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of energy packs on great weight, but also becomes tireless. For every 10 charges you tap, your body weight increases by 25% and in any hour when you perform strenuous activity you lose 1 die with Physique rolls for every 10 charges tapped. However, you also gain 1 die with rolls made to conceal your appearance.
## Hemalurgy
Bendalloy has no known Hemalurgic applications.
# Atium
Atium is one of the most valuable commodities in the Final Empire. It’s found in only one location — the Pits of Hathsin — and its geodes are mined by hand using a work force of prisoners and slaves toiling under extremely dangerous conditions. The metal is so valuable that caches of it are used instead of money for most critical purchases and deals, including Contracts with kandra spies and trade agreements between the noble houses. All the Great Houses count atium as a core measure of their wealth.
## Allomancy
A Misting who can only burn Atium is called a Seer.
Atium is the most powerful Allomantic metal ­commonly known to the Final Empire, treasured because burning it makes one nearly unstoppable in combat. It lets a character see a few seconds into the possible ­futures of others, revealing them as incorporeal “atium-shadows.” To an outside observer, the character becomes virtually indomitable, ­casually parrying and sidestepping blows, ­effortlessly landing hits, and almost never caught off-guard.
There are few counters to Atium, the most obvious of which is to burn Atium in response, thereby seeing the Atium-burner’s potential reactions, and ­responding accordingly. Another is to burn Electrum, which grants similar visions of one’s own actions. Of course, the number and complexity of shadows rises exponentially when characters burning these metals face off, and in the end they effectively negate each others’ advantages.
Another, far more difficult defense is to deliberately act on instinct, hoping the Atium-burner won’t see one’s intentions until it’s too late. This is dangerous, however, and requires incredible raw skill, as anyone relying solely on reflexes to get the job done takes strategy completely out of the equation.
Atium’s awesome power comes at a price — its incredibly fast burn rate. A single bead of the metal is costly and burns away in less than minute. Fortunately for the vast majority of people who can’t burn the metal, those few with access to it jealously guard their stores, only using them in moments of dire need.
### Rules
While burning Atium, you see shadowy visions of those around you, projected from one Beat in the future. You cannot see their surroundings, only those ­currently in your line of sight and the actions they might take. For example, you might see an opponent moving to attack one of your Crew mates, or may not see a character at all (indicating that they’re likely to leave your line of sight with their next action).
Once per Beat, you may ask the Narrator or any other player what a single character under their control plans to do in the next Beat. They must answer and — unless the action becomes impossible — they must take the action as described in the next Beat. Characters burning Atium or Electrum are immune and need not answer, or may answer and then do something else, as they prefer. Should an Atium- or Electrum-burner refuse to answer, you may ask another character in the current Beat, but if they answer at all then you lose the option to ask anyone else.
Atium has other benefits as well, which are most applicable in a Conflict...
- During Step 1 of each round, you may declare your action after characters not burning Atium or Electrum; characters burning these metals declare their actions simultaneously (by writing them on a piece of paper and revealing them at the same time).
- During Step 2 of each round, your declared action is resolved before ­characters not burning Atium; the actions of characters burning these metals are resolved simultaneously.
- Finally, you gain a number of dice with each action equal to your Atium ­rating. This is true no matter what the action is, so long as it requires a roll, but there is a limitation — should your action target or oppose a ­character burning Electrum (such as attack against such a character, or a Contest against them), the dice are reduced by the target’s Electrum rating (to a minimum of 0 bonus dice).
### Burn Rate
Atium is the fastest burning metal, at a rate of 1 charge every 30 seconds.
### Flaring Atium & Atium Savants
Atium burns so quickly and is so ­expensive that Allomancers don’t bother flaring it. Consequently, there are also no Atium Savants.
### Stunts
#### Atium Advantage
When burning Atium, you may reduce the pool of a character defending or reacting to one of your actions by 2 dice. If this reduces the pool to less than 2 dice, the character’s defense or reaction automatically fails.
#### Atium Nudge
When burning Atium, you may reduce your rating with the metal by 2 to gain 1 free Nudge with each roll you make in the current Beat. You may take this Stunt multiple times, each time increasing the amount you can ­reduce your Atium rating by 2, and the free Nudges you gain with this round’s rolls by 1 (so if you take the Stunt twice, you may reduce your Atium rating by 2 to gain 1 free Nudge with this round’s rolls or you can reduce your Atium rating by 4 to gain 2 free Nudges with this round’s rolls, and so on).
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists use Atium to store youth, during which they visibly age (though as usual for Feruchemy, only ­temporarily). Tapping youth restores verve and vigor, and tapping large amounts of it can actually roll back the years, reversing the aging process, at least for a time. In conjunction with an ­aluminummind, this could potentially revert a character to nearly any age in both body and mind.
The practical applications of stored youth are mainly ­limited to disguise and deception, but many Feruchemists dream of using Atium to remain eternally young. So far only one has succeeded — the Lord Ruler. He combined Feruchemy and Allomancy to burn atiumminds containing stored youth, and thus magnified the effects of his stored charges. This is how he ­remained young throughout his thousand-year rule.
### Storing
While storing youth, you visibly age approximately five years per charge currently being stored. This ravages the body, and so you lose 1 die per two charges currently being stored with Physique rolls. ­However, you gain 1 die per charge currently being stored with rolls to disguise your identity, particularly when passing yourself off as an older person. The ­maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Atium rating or your Physique score minus 1, whichever is lower.
### Tapping
For each charge you tap, your visible age reverts by approximately five years, and for every two charges tapped you gain 1 die with rolls to disguise your identity, particularly when passing yourself off as a younger person.
#### Tapping 10 or More Charges of Atium
A Feruchemist who taps huge amounts of youth actually reverts in age, though only for a single day. This process eliminates injuries, scars, and other physical features acquired in the intervening time — for all intents and purposes the character actually is his or her younger self. This process only changes your body; to completely revert, you must also tap large amounts of identity (see page 339).
The amount of youth tapped determines how far back you may regress:

| Charges Tapped | Restores your body as it was up to X time ago |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 10             | and hour                                      |
| 20             | a day                                         |
| 30             | a week                                        |
| 40             | a month                                       |
| 50             | a year                                        |
| 75             | a decade                                      |
| 100            | any younger age                               |
## Hemalurgy
Atium spikes are incredibly expensive to create, but are also highly versatile. Depending on where the spike is driven in, it steals, stores, and transfers a single Allomantic Power — that of Atium, or a Power derived from any one of the four Temporal Metals (e.g. the ability to see one’s past, see one’s future, slow time, or accelerate it). Each spike may store only one Power.
### Spike
Costs 2 x Allomancy rating [[Advancements]]
An Atium spike grants you a single Allomantic Power — Atium, Gold, Electrum, Cadmium, or Bendalloy — with a rating equal to that of the spike. Each spike reduces your Spirit by 1, as normal.
# Malatium
Also known as “the Eleventh Metal,” this silvery alloy of atium and gold is even rarer and more mysterious than Atium itself.
## Allomancy
Malatium functions similarly to Gold, but lets an Allomancer see the possible pasts of others. These pasts are revealed as silent, ghostly images without substance, playing out next to anyone the character watches while burning the metal. Each image shows what a target’s past might have been, if he or she had made different choices, and from these the Allomancer can glean much. It was Malatium, for example, that let Vin see the Lord Ruler as he was before the Ascension, and from this she came to understand the truth about the Hero of Ages.
### Rules
While burning Malatium, you see spectral versions of those within your line of sight, each revealing an alternate past they might have lived. Time elapses in these visions as it does in reality — you experience one minute of each alternate past for every minute you burn Malatium in the present. There’s no limit to how far back you can peer into someone’s past using Malatium and alternate pasts ­appear to you with crystal clarity.
The Narrator may require a Malatium roll if you wish to witness a very specific parallel (“What if he’d made this decision?” rather than “What’s another way this could have gone?”). The more specific the divergence and the further back in time it occurs, the higher the roll’s Difficulty.
This Power has several interesting applications, such as learning details about the target that might not otherwise be available, seeing through deceptions he or she has established to conceal past deeds, and even modeling behavior and values from choices he or she didn’t make. As with exploring the consequences of ­specific divergences, a Malatium roll may be required for any of these efforts, with a Difficulty based on the same factors.
### Burn Rate
As an Atium alloy, Malatium burns quickly — 1 minute per charge, or 6 seconds per charge when flared.
### Flaring
Flaring Malatium provides no additional benefits beyond increasing your Malatium rating.
## Feruchemy
Malatium has no known Feruchemical applications.
## Hemalurgy
Malatium has no known Hemalurgical applications.
# Lerasium
This is the rarest of all Allomantic metals — indeed, of all the elements — as it’s formed from Preservation itself. It’s only found near the Well of Ascension, a place lost in time immemorial, and only a small handful of people have encountered it in the long h­ istory of the Final Empire.
Larasium is also the most powerful metal in Allomancy. Unlike other elements, it can be burned by any human — skaa, noble, or Terris, Allomancer or no. Consuming and burning pure Larasium ­transforms a person into an Allomancer as they existed at the dawn of the Empire — tremendously strong with all metals. It can also be combined with other metals, forming alloys that awaken supreme Misting ability.
There are almost certainly other uses for the metal as well, though no one has yet had a large enough stockpile of the invaluable metal to seek them out.
## Allomancy
### Rules
Any human character may burn pure Larasium, or an alloy containing the metal. When you burn pure Larasium, you become a powerful Mistborn with a rating of 5 in all Allomantic metals (unless of course your rating with a metal is already higher, in which case it increases by 1).
Alloys of Larasium and other Allomantic metals should be introduced ­carefully, and should always directly support the story at hand. When you burn one, you become a powerful Misting with a rating of 6 in the alloy’s other metal, and two Stunts for it as well. Thus, if you found and burned an alloy of Larasium and Pewter, you would gain Pewter 6 with two Pewter Stunts.
If a Misting already able to burn a Larasium alloy’s other metal were to consume and burn the alloy, his or her rating with the other metal would increase by 1 (thus, a Thug with a Pewter rating of 5 who consumed and burned an alloy of Larasium and Pewter would gain a rating of 6).
In the unlikely event that a Misting able to burn a different metal were to consume and burn a Larasium alloy, it would have the same effect as on a character with no Powers: the Misting’s current metal would be replaced with the alloy metal, at a rating of 6 and with two Stunts. Thus, if a Steel Misting found and burned an alloy of Larasium and Pewter, he or she would lose the ability to burn Steel and gain Pewter 6 with two Pewter Stunts.
A character may only benefit from consuming and burning Larasium or a Larasium alloy once; after that it has no effect.
## Feruchemy
Larasium has no known Feruchemical applications.
## Hemalurgy
Larasium has no known Hemalurgical applications.
