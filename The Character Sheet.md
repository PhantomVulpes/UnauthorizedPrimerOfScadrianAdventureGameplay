Powers have numerical ratings to determine their strength when used.
## Allomancy
Mistborn and Mistings can consume various metals depending on what metal was used.
## Feruchemy
Feruchemists can store traits within various metals. Metal containing an attribute is called a **metalmind**. The trait being stored depends on the type of **metalmind** used.
## Hemalurgy
A power can be granted to a human using a **Hemalurgic spike**. Infusing a metal spike with power involved killing someone using the spike who possesses the desired power and then piercing the body with that spike. The power stolen depends on the metal used and where the spike is placed.
## Mimicry
A kandra can mimic the forms of a body they consume
# Traits

Examples:
- Lord Venture's Son
- Burglar
- Quick Witted
- Brawny
- Historian
- Tactical
- Informant
A trait must follow these four rules: A trait must...
- Be specific
- Be descriptive
- Not replicate any other statistic, trait, term, or ability
    - Traits like "Healthy", "Charming", or "Allomancer" are off limits
- Be approved by your GM
## Destiny and Tragedy
May be unknown to the character, waiting to be discovered in-game
The character may believe their destined for one thing but really another
These should unfold throughout the narrative like subplots for each character to overcome
When handling Destiny or Tragedy in-game, these should be momentous occasions, or even warrant [[Advancements]].
### Destiny
A higher purpose that may or may not have been fated
### Tragedy
A traumatic event that haunts the character to this day
# Props
Essential parts of the character.
Props, unlike normal items, are regained after a [[Time During the Game#Long Breathers|Long Breather]] unless context demands otherwise (such as loaning a tool to another character)
See [[Game Items]] for available props and [[Game Items#Props|the Props section]] for how to buy them
