Negative Traits from a particularly powerful attack or event
- **Editor's Note**: The book doesn't say "event" but I assume being taken out by an avalanche could result in a burden as well
Characters do not choose their Burdens, but are assigned by who or what inflicted it.
Burdens cannot remove dice from a character
- They are targeted by an attacker during a [[Conflicts|Conflict]] and **add** dice to the attacker's roll.
**The first time in any session a Burden is invoked, that character immediately gains 1 [[Advancements#Earning Advancements|Advancement]].**
# Severities of a Burden
Each level of severity has a number of dice that get added to a roll when invoked.
## Serious - 1
**Health**: Cuts, bruises, or other fleeting damage to be healed to the point of unimportance in a few days
**Reputation**: Embarrassment or censure from a particularly poor conflict that those involved will have forgotten in a few days or less
**Willpower**: Nightmares, a depressive episode, or other episodes to break the otherwise stable mind
## Grave - 2
**Health**: Broken bones, internal damage, aches that will last more than a week or two in the best of circumstances
**Reputation**: Severe fines or the unexpected attention of an Obligator
**Willpower**: Compulsions or delusions
## Mortal - 3
**Health**: Profound, permanent injuries such as a lost arm or crippled legs
**Reputation**: Forfeited holdings, exile
**Willpower**: Severe paranoia or obsession
# Recovering from a Burden
**Serious** and **Grave** burdens can only be recovered during a [[Time During the Game#Long Breathers|Long Breather]].
Only a single Burden can be recovered during a Long Breather
A burden may require longer to recover from depending on its severity.
- _Example:_ A pierced forearm may take four weeks to fully heal, but this Long Breather is only for two weeks. The player may choose to spend the Long Breather to recover, but it will need more time
**Mortal** Burdens may _only_ be healed by spending [[Advancements]].
