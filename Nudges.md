Player characters and significant non-player characters may use Nudges
**Editor's Note**: I don't see anything in this section so far about saving Nudges for later. We may have gotten that from somewhere else, this book has ADHD, but as it stands, Nudges _can not be saved_.
- **Editor's Note**: In our game, we have opted to allow for saving up to 10 nudges. Once a player has 10 nudges, they gain an [[Advancements|Advancement]] and lose all saved nudges. They cannot be used for anything other than an advancement
# Augmenting Success
A player may nudge that success once for every 6 that was rolled to reach the outcome
When scoring **3 or more Nudges** at once, that character may choose to [[Time During the Game#Catching a Beat|Catch a Beat]].
A Nudged success could be several small bonuses
- An extra question during an interrogation
- Intimidating a character and taking advantage of it in the future
- Reduce the time it takes for an action, as long as that action is more than one Beat
Nudges on success boil down to the following
- Time saving
- +1 to a roll
- Additional in-context bonus
# Mitigating Failure
An applied Nudge reduces the number of [[Rolling the Dice#Complications|Complications]] of a roll by 1, before they are chosen
# Nudges in [[Conflicts|Combat]] - p.192
Nudges gain the following added effects during combat:
- Deal 1 extra Damage
- Remove 1 of the Attacker's **Action** or **Defense** Dice from what remains _after_ the attack
- Gain a bonus **Action Die** in the _following_ round
    - If a player wishes to use a Nudge to increase their dice pool in the middle of a round, they _cannot_.
    - This counts toward the total **Action Dice** when determining turn order
    - Gain insight about the Conflict
        - A new detail or hint from the GM
The same attack may be Nudged the same way more than once
With three or more Nudges, a Character can spend them all to **Catch a Beat**
- **Editor's Note**: I don't know for sure, but the book makes it sound like if you want to Catch a Beat, you must have three Nudges to use and spend _all_ of them to do so.
