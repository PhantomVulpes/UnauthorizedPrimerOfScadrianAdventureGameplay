# Metalminds
Metal jewelry is closely tied to Terris culture, many nobles even wearing wooden replicas in admiration of the intricate accessories
Many Feruchemists use their jewelry as metalminds
Metalminds can come in various styles
- Rings
- Bracelets
- Necklaces and Torques
- Coins
- Weapons and Armor
- Piercings
All metalminds are normally a selection between Brass, Bronze, Copper, Iron, Pewter, Steel, Tin, or Zinc. Your DM may allow you a broader selection of metals depending on your campaign

### Double Metalmind
This practice uses extremely pure metals double-braided to forge a vast reserve out of a small amount of metal
Potential reserve of the metalmind is considered one size greater
- Rings store 100 instead of 25 as is defined in [[Feruchemy#Storage Capacity|Base Game Feruchemy]] rules
### Metalmind Clothing
Clothing or shoes woven with metalic thread
Typically reserved for formal clothing such as a steward's robes
This clothing is normally identified as fancy dress
Under close scrutiny, an observer aware of Feruchemy may attempt a Wits - DC 4 [[Rolling the Dice#Challenges|Challege]] to determine it can be used as a metalmind
Low storage capacity, only 25 charges
### Multimind
Five separate metals blended into a single piece
Low storage, each metal can only store 25 charges
