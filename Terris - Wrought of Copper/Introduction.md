_Terris: Wrought of Copper_ is a world resource, rule supplement, and module for the base adventure game.
# In the primer
I will not be including any of the new lore explored in the world guide. The [Coppermind](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome) should have everything you need for lore. If you see any groups or locations or names you're unfamiliar with when reading the primer, then go there to find information. The primer is not a second wiki, it is exclusively for the tabletop RPG.
All new mechanics and rules will be included here rather than in the base game. There is some information that may end up in the main primer, but that is exclusively for convenience such as with [[Advancements]]. This is so players and GMs will be able to introduce these rules as they see fit for their games, getting the vanilla experience if they want or expanding into one or more world supplements.
The modules will also be included, though they may take longer to add to the primer as they are not always the highest priority.
