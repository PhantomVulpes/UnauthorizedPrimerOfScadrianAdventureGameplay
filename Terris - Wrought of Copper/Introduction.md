_Terris: Wrought of Copper_ is a world resource, rule supplement, and module for the base adventure game.
# In the primer
Similar to the base game, the primer is being written as if you already know the world's lore. Rules and information will be added as it pertains to playing a game within the world of Mistborn Era 1. It will fully assume you know anything and everything lore wise and will only explain to you what they are if it matters to rules and mechanics. If something looks unfamiliar to you, then it is up to you to look it up. As much as I'd like to add the lore that's filled in with the book, I'm not going to just make a second [Coppermind wiki](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome).
The module will also be included as campaign details
- **Editor's Note**: This is going to be a lot of work, so assume I haven't started yet as what is below takes priority.
