Upon a successful attack, the damage dealt is the following
- 1 base damage + 1 for each nudge applied + Tools bonuses
    - It does not seem as though the level of success is important in determining damage, but may apply to an additional outcome
## Wounds
If a **single attack** takes down 25% of a character's **remaining targeted Resilience** (rounded up), they suffer a **[[Burdens|Serious Burden]]**.
If a **single attack** takes down 50% of a character's **remaining targeted Resilience** (rounded up), they suffer a **[[Burdens|Grave Burden]]**.
Each attack may only inflict one wound
A character may meet the threshold for a wound during multiple attacks in a round. Each attack produces the relevant burden. Good luck.
## Defeat
Upon hitting 0 of any Resilience, the character is defeated.
The defeated character gains a **Grave Burden** or a **Mortal Burden**, by the attacker's preference.
Depending on the lost Resilience, the character suffers one of the following fates:
### Incapacitated - Health
The character is left unconscious, dying, or dead, by the attacker's preference
#### Unconscious
Unconscious characters wake up at a "dramatically appropriate moment"
- Yes, that's what the book literally says
#### Dying
The character dies after an appropriate amount of time in context, or when the character suffers more damage to their **Health**
Dying characters may be saved with a successful **Wits 3** roll
- The character is **stabilized** but _does not recover any health_.
### Disgraced - Reputation
Favors are denied, contracts fall through, old contacts refuse help. A Disgraced character has lost all power afforded by worldly status
### Devastated - Willpower
A character who is Devastated is unable to resist acting on any emotion or impulse suggested by an attacker, provided the suggestion does not involve direct harm or particularly heinous acts
- Fallout from such an action may result in such an action, however.
# Recovery
The GM may recover points as is appropriate in context, such as a well-applied bandage or a noble showing compliance in public.
Generally, each Resilience is recovered by 1 for every day
### Breathers
#### Short Breather
A character may choose to forgo other actions for recovering half the Health lost
Regardless of forgoing other actions, a character recovers half the **Willpower** or **Reputation** lost
#### Long Breather
A character recovers all of the lost Resiliences. No time is lost
