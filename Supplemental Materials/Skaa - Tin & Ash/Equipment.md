# Poisons
An effective means of incapacitating a target without killing them
Highly illegal
Difficult to procure
Can be used to lace food or drinks
Can be applied to weaponry
When a target is poisoned, they instantly suffer a [[Burdens#Serious - 1|Serious Burden]] as listed under the effect of the poison
- If attacking with a poisoned weapon and that attack would inflict a Burden, the attacker must chose which burden to inflict: That of the attack _or_ the poison, but not both
Poisons are measured in single doses
