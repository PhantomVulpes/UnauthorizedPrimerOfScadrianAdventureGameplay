# For the GM
You may assign a Difficulty if there's a valid reason the action may not succeed
Dice during a round are single use
A character may only **react** or **defend** once against an action, regardless of how many dice they may have
A character may spend [[Nudges#Nudges in Conflicts (Combat) Combat - p.192|Nudges]] to **Catch a Beat**
- Immediately gain another action before anyone else can act
- Catching a Beat does not grant additional dice
## Extras
Extras are unimportant grunts with 1 HP that can be brushed aside en mass. One successful attack is all it takes to defeat one
## Beats
Conflicts are measured in beats.
Combat beats are typically a few seconds
Social Conflicts could last from hours to days, or months even
Mental Conflicts can shift dramatically 
# Before Starting Combat
Establish locations of characters
# Starting a Round
## Determine turn order
Order the players by their Wits from lowest to highest, the character with the best response time goes last.
Surprised characters are first, regardless of their wits
- This comes after the surprising incident
    - **Editor's Note**: I don't think the book clarifies this, so I did
### If there is a tie
Depending on context of the characters, the GM determines who makes the most sense to go second
## Declare actions
In the previous order, characters determine their action.
When attacking, the character also declares their target Resilience
- The GM may change the targeted Resilience given the context
Dice for this action are counted the same as any other action outside of combat 
- _Example:_ Checking their weakness requires Wits, so 5 dice. I am an assassin, so +1 die to the roll
These dice become **Action Dice**. Unlike normal rolls, you may have more than 10.
- No more than 10 can be rolled at once.
A character with 0 in any HP slot loses 2 dice on the relevant stat rolls, as mentioned in [[Rolling the Dice]]
Movement reduces the character's **Action Dice** by 1, counting as a negative **Circumstance**
### Defending
A character may choose to defend against incoming attacks. Dice are determined in the same manor as Action Dice, but are instead **Defense Dice**.
Action Dice can be used as Defense Dice.
### Actions with No Dice
Some actions will not require a roll, example given is turning a valve.
Character instead gains **Defense Dice** if attacked
The gained Defense Dice is determined by the attack, but no extra detail can be provided.
- Traits are allowed, but the character is preoccupied, so grabbing a shield or bracing behind cover can't be done
# Reactions
A reaction is performed _in response_ to another event, action, or circumstance.
- If one action throws coins onto the ground, a Lurcher may pull the coins to them.
A character may either react to or defend against an action **but they may not do both**.
Dice for a reaction are specifically for that reaction and are discarded upon resolution.
Action Dice or Defense Dice may be used, but the dice pool cannot exceed 10.
# Resolving Actions
## Determine Turn Order. Again.
This is the real turn order.
Order each character's turn by the number of their **Action Dice**.
- Characters with the same number of Action Dice take their turn simultaneously
- **Editor's Note**: The book does not mention **Defense Dice** during this step, so I assume they are irrelevant here.
## Perform Your Turn
As each character's turn comes up, a player may respond to all declarations and actions up to that point
A player may do one of the following
### Take the Declared Action
The player takes from their pool of **Action Dice** to perform their action. This number _must_ fall between 2 and 10 as normal.
Any remaining **Action Dice** after performing the action become **Defense Dice**
When a character attacks another, their **Defense Dice** are taken from their pool of **Action Dice**.
- Those Action Dice are not gained back when it is the target's actual turn
- The spent dice **change the turn order**
#### Not Defending Against an Attack
The attack is automatically a success, provided the attacker rolls a pair.
#### Ties
Some attacks may result in a tie
More nudges break ties
- Nudges tied results in the conflict resuming in the next round
### Declare a new Action
A player may decide it's best to take a different action.
Discard all **Action Dice**
Declare and figure the new **Action Dice** as before.
Halve the action dice, rounding up.
This character now goes at the **end of the round**
- **Editor's Note**: The book says "(as if they have only 1 Action Dice)" but I am choosing to ignore that. Going last and having 1 Action Die are not the same thing, it is possible to have 0 Action Dice. I think the writers just didn't realize this could happen for some reason?
### Choose not to act
Convert all **Action Dice** to **Defense Dice**
### Yield
Instead of acting, the character may **Yield**.
The characters negotiate what it takes to get out of the Conflict safely, be it money, services, favors, etc...
- Both parties must agree to the terms of the negotiation or the Conflict does not end
## Damage
![[Damage]]
# Nudges in Combat
![[Nudges#Nudges in Conflicts (Combat) Combat - p.192]]
# Range and Movement - p.198
Distance is measured in **Paces**
A character may take one step during each beat, barring powers, counted as an adverse action and **reduces the character's Action Dice** by 1.
- A character may forgo their **Action** and **Defense** dice for the round to take two steps

| Range    | Description - Close enough to... | Paces      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Touch    | Touch the target                 | Adjacent   |
| Striking | Attack with a melee weapon       | 1 - 2      |
| Close    | Attack with a thrown weapon      | 3 - 10     |
| Medium   | Attack with a spear              | 11 - 100   |
| Long     | Attack with a bow                | 100 - 300  |
| Extreme  | Attack with a catapult           | 300 - 1000 |
| Sight    | See the target, but not attack   | 1000+      |
