# Types of Rolls
## Challenges
When a tries to do something without opposition from another character
Challenges are the most common roll
**Editor's Note**: While Contests and Conflicts both have their own page, Challenges doesn't really need it. All rolls that apply to Challenges also apply to those. This page is a sort of psuedo Challenges page
## Contests
When two or more characters compete
See [[Contests]] for more information
## Conflicts
When one character tries to harm another in some way
See [[Conflicts]]
# Dice Pools
A dice pool is between **2 and 10** dice
1. Depending on the Attribute used, the number next to that stat is the initial pool
2. Apply the relevant traits to support the action being performed
- The GM and players may challenge each other for why that bonus should or should not be awarded
- Traits may also be used to remove a die from a player's pool
3. Apply bonuses from tools that _are not necessary_ to perform the action
- If an action requires an item, i.e. lock picking, then the action is already being supported by that item. It does not provide any bonuses
- If a character lacks an item that would aid dramatically, but is not necessary, the pool may shrink
4. Apply [[Circumstances]]
- A character with 0 in any Resilience slot loses 2 dice on the relevant stat rolls
## Pools Above Ten Dice
Gain 1 free [[Nudges|Nudge]] for each die above 10
These Nudges may only be used on success
## Pools Below Two Dice
Roll 2 dice
[[Rolling the Dice#Outcome|Outcome]] is reduced for each die below 2
## Challenge Rating
| Assign this difficulty | When a task is    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1                      | Simple            |
| 2                      | Challenging       |
| 3                      | Difficult         |
| 4                      | Very Hard         |
| 5                      | Nearly Impossible |
# Actually Rolling the Pool
Numbers 1-5 are read as normal
6s become [[Nudges]]
Choose the pair of dice as your result
- **Example**: You roll 1, 3, 1, 6, 3. The result can either be 1 or 3, usually selecting the higher number
# Outcome
A player's result meeting or not meeting the challenge rating does not mean pass or fail

| Outcome | "That was..." |
| ------- | ------------- |
| 6       | Godlike       |
| 5       | Legendary     |
| 4       | Astounding    |
| 3       | Amazing       |
| 2       | Excellent     |
| 1       | Good          |
| 0       | Passable      |
| -1      | Just shy      |
| -2      | Unfortunate   |
| -3      | Cringeworthy  |
